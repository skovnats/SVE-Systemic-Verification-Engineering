# S.V.E.: Systemic Verification Engineering
Systemic Verification Engineering (SVE), an applied discipline designed to address the systemic crisis of trust in modern institutions. We ground this necessity in the Disaster Prevention Theorem, which formally diagnoses the vulnerability of systems based on mediated information. We then present the solution: the SVE Protocol, a three-stage architecture that separates factual analysis (``Caesar's Realm'') from value judgment (``God's Realm''). At its core is a computational engine---the Epistemological Boxing Protocol---based on vectorial analysis and adversarial purification of narratives. We detail a specific application of this architecture, \textsc{System-Purgatory}, which transforms academic peer review into a transparent verification mechanism. The protocol is architected to be ``antifragile'' and ``Limited by Design,'' providing a scalable, operational standard for restoring institutional trust.
