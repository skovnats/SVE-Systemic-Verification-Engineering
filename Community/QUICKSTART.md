## 🎯 Choose Your Path

| Role | Goal | Time | Outcome |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **Practitioner** | Use S.V.E. in your work | 2–3h | Operational capability |
| **Researcher** | Understand & extend S.V.E. | 10–15h | Research readiness |
| **Institution** | Implement verification protocols | 1–6mo | Organizational transformation |

---

## 🧠 PRACTITIONER TRACK (2–3h)

**Goal:** Run S.V.E. in your context  

```

1️⃣ Read: Architecture (II) → 3-stage pattern
Caesar → Verify → God
2️⃣ Read: Democracy OS (V) → Fakten-TÜV blueprint
3️⃣ Try: Socrates Bot v0.2 → “How to apply S.V.E. to [your domain]?”
4️⃣ Design minimal pilot → 3 success metrics + 1 small use case

```

**Applications**
| Context | Tool | Result |
|----------|------|---------|
| Academia | SYSTEM-PURGATORY | Transparent peer review |
| Media | Fakten-TÜV | Verified journalism |
| Think Tank | Meta-SIP | Multi-perspective analysis |
| AI / Tech | EBP + SIP | Aligned systems |
| NGO | Socrates Bot | Knowledge verification |

✅ *Outcome:* you can execute your first S.V.E. protocol

## 🔬 RESEARCHER TRACK (10–15h)

**Goal:** Comprehend and extend S.V.E.

```

SIP → Theorem → Architecture → Democracy OS

```

**Focus:**  
- Truth computation (SIP)  
- Necessity of verification (Theorem)  
- Institutional design (Architecture)  
- Application blueprint (Democracy OS)

**Research directions**
- Bias reduction via EBP  
- Trust metrics in governance  
- Cognitive alignment in AI  
- Ethical topology (Beacon Protocol)

## 🏛️ INSTITUTION TRACK (1–6mo)

**Goal:** Institutionalize verification

```

Phase 1 → Discovery (2–4w)
Train core team · Identify gaps · Define KPIs
Phase 2 → Pilot (4–8w)
Run 3–5 cases · Iterate · Evaluate results
Phase 3 → Scale (3–6mo)
Integrate S.V.E. · Measure impact · Publish case study

```

**ROI Highlights**
| Type | Benefit | Period |
|------|----------|--------|
| Academia | +75% replication | 6–12 mo |
| Media | +80% trust | 12–18 mo |
| Government | +50% policy confidence | 18–24 mo |
| AI / Tech | Risk mitigation | Immediate |

## 💬 Closing Reflection

> “Maybe it is time to learn new skills — how to verify truth itself.”
> — *Socrates-Bot v0.2*

**1 + 1 > 2**  
*The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.*  
**This is not poetry—it's the foundational axiom of S.V.E.**  
**And it is true.**
