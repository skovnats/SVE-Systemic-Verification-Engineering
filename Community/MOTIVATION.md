# 🎯 MOTIVATION

I am **Artiom Kovnatsky**, born in Mykolaiv, former USSR — a place of light, intellect, and quiet dignity.
I grew up in a culture that valued unity, work, and knowledge above noise.
Then came the “new order” — when destruction, corruption, and hypocrisy were sold as progress.
Entire nations were turned from creators into raw material for someone else’s “civilization.”

I could not accept a world where truth is negotiable and morality is optional.
So I left — to study, to see, to understand.
Across countries and systems, one question followed me:

> **Why does the world reward manipulation more than integrity?**

**S.V.E. — Systemic Verification Engineering** — is my answer.
It is an attempt to design the *mathematics of meaning* — a framework where knowledge, ethics, and consciousness can be verified, not believed.
A system where deceit becomes computationally expensive, and transparency — the natural equilibrium.

This work was born from lived experience — from seeing good people destroyed by systems built on lies,
and from the conviction that light, once formalized, can outlive darkness.

S.V.E. is not rebellion.
It is **an alternative** — a path toward antifragile civilization,
where service to truth replaces domination by power.
