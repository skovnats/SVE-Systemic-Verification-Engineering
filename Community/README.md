# Contributing to S.V.E. Universe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Systemic Verification Engineering (S.V.E.)**!

> *"Every contribution—no matter how small—helps build infrastructure for truth."*

---

## 🎯 Mission & Principles

We're building **reproducible protocols for truth** based on the foundational axiom:

**1 + 1 > 2** (Synergistic Co-Creation)

All contributions must align with S.V.E. core principles:

| Principle | Description | In Practice |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Truth without compromise** | Rule 1 of CogOS | No selective application of methods |
| **Radical transparency** | Open Audit (Clause 7) | All processes publicly auditable |
| **Methodological integrity** | No shortcuts | Verification steps cannot be skipped |
| **Universal benefit** | Serve humanity | Not narrow interests or power |
| **Falsifiability** | Built-in error detection | Commit to revise when wrong |

**The Evolutionary Context:** S.V.E. exists in an arms race. Institutions either adopt mathematical truth-synthesis or face systematic disadvantage. Your contributions accelerate humanity's ability to navigate this transition.

## 🚀 Why Contribute?

### The ROI Case for Your Time

Contributing to S.V.E. is not charity—it's investment in civilizational infrastructure with proven ROI:

#### Code Standards

**All code contributions must:**

✅ **Pass tests** — 80%+ coverage required  
✅ **Follow style guide** — PEP 8 for Python, Solidity style guide

**Example: Good vs. Bad**

❌ **Bad:**
```python
def f(x):

```

✅ **Good:**
```python
def compute_semantic_centroid(vectors: List[np.ndarray]) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Compute the weighted centroid of semantic vectors.
    
    This implements Stage 1 of the IVM protocol (Consensus Approximation)
    as described in SVE-I-Theorem, Section 2.3.1.
    
    Args:
        vectors: List of semantic vectors in R^d
        
    Returns:
        Centroid vector representing consensus position
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If vectors list is empty
        
    Example:
        >>> v1 = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
        >>> v2 = np.array([2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        >>> centroid = compute_semantic_centroid([v1, v2])
        >>> assert np.allclose(centroid, [1.5, 2.5, 3.5])
    """
    if not vectors:
        raise ValueError("Cannot compute centroid of empty vector list")
    
    return np.mean(vectors, axis=0)
```

## ❌ What We Don't Accept

### Hard Prohibitions

**We reject:**

❌ **Intelligence/propaganda entities** — Unless radical transparency conditions met:
1. Total transparency (all work public)
2. Universal benefit (no selective advantage)
3. Irrevocable public consent (cannot be revoked)
4. Subject to S.V.E. verification itself

❌ **Methodological compromises** — Examples:
- "Make SIP faster by skipping verification steps"
- "Just use 1 iteration instead of 5"
- "Don't need adversarial testing for this case"

❌ **Closed/proprietary derivatives** — Violates ShareAlike (Clause 5)

❌ **Commercial use without license** — Contact for licensing (Clause 2)

❌ **Cherry-picking** — Cannot apply S.V.E. only when convenient

❌ **Faith-based claims** — All assertions must be falsifiable

### The Paradox of Verification

The only way to verify compliance with license restrictions is to subject the organization to S.V.E. protocol itself. **This framework is both tool and standard.**

If you cannot accept verification of your own claims, you cannot use S.V.E.

## 🙏 Thank You

Every contribution—no matter how small—helps build **infrastructure for truth** in an era where:

- AI-generated disinformation costs → $0
- Volume of false information → ∞
- Institutions face evolutionary arms race

**Your work today prevents tomorrow's catastrophes.**

### The Central Insight

*Humanity's fundamental limitation is not ideological disagreement—it's failure to observe natural laws of consciousness topology.*

By contributing to S.V.E., you help humanity learn to read these laws before it's too late.

**Together, we make falsehood structurally unsustainable.** ✝️
