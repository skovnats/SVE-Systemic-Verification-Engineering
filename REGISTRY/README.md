# SVE / Exodus 3.0 Authorized Public Custodians (v1.3)

Each listed custodian may independently (and voluntarily) sign and execute **SVE Commercial Agreements** under the same **SVE Public License v1.3** and **Ethical Partnership Model (Appendix B v1.3)**.  
All custodians act symbolically and without legal obligation, serving as moral representatives of transparency, free knowledge, and public stewardship.  
Authorizations are public, timestamped, and may be expanded or revoked by community consensus.

### Notes & Governance Rules
1. Inclusion here is **symbolic and voluntary**; no listed person or organization is bound by fiduciary or contractual duty unless they later sign a formal custodian pledge.  
2. Any custodian may resign at any time by public statement; new custodians can be proposed through a **Snapshot vote or three-signature co-optation**.  
3. This registry is version-controlled and timestamped (Git commit + OpenTimestamps + IPFS CID).  
4. Only the most recent timestamped version constitutes the valid public record.

2. Commit to GitHub → generate commit hash.
3. Run OpenTimestamps on the file → keep `.ots` proof.
4. Pin the file to IPFS (Pinata / Filebase).
5. Link its hash in your **Declaration v1.3** and **Commercial License v1.3**.
