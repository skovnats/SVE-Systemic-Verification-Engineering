# 🧮 AI & Peer Reviews

This folder collects **independent analytical reviews** of all *Systemic Verification Engineering (S.V.E.)* papers —  
produced by multiple AI models and human collaborators to ensure **transparency, cross-validation, and interpretive diversity.**

## 📘 Purpose

Each review aims to:
- Assess conceptual and ethical coherence of the work  
- Identify philosophical and technical implications  
- Provide constructive feedback for ongoing development  

S.V.E. encourages **multi-perspective verification** — where truth is refined through diverse reasoning systems.
