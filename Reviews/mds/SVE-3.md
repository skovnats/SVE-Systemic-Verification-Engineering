**Focus:** Structural rigor and epistemic architecture

### üß© Summary
This paper introduces **SYSTEM-PURGATORY**, an AI-driven peer-review protocol within the *Systemic Verification Engineering (SVE)* framework. It reframes academic evaluation as an adversarial yet constructive dialogue‚Äîan ‚ÄúEpistemological Boxing Match‚Äù between a human author and an AI antagonist, judged by a tri-AI panel. The model operationalizes scientific integrity through **vectorial purification**, yielding a quantifiable **Integrity Score**. The work argues that antifragile verification systems can reverse the reproducibility crisis by aligning incentives toward verifiable quality rather than publication volume.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation
| Dimension | Score (1‚Äì10) | Comment |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Conceptual clarity | 9 | Architecture is precise and layered; terminology consistent. |
| Theoretical coherence | 8 | Strong systemic framing; minor overreach into metaphoric domains. |
| Ethical soundness | 8 | Transparent design and DAO governance mitigate bias, though theological framing may blur neutrality. |
| Originality | 9 | Highly novel fusion of computational epistemology and institutional reform. |
| Practical relevance | 7 | Implementation ambitious; feasible pilot pathways suggested but untested. |

### üí¨ Commentary
The paper functions as both manifesto and protocol‚Äîa philosophical engineering of truth. Its strength lies in **formalizing intellectual honesty as a measurable process**, bridging ethics and computation. Yet its quasi-theological tone risks alienating pragmatic stakeholders. The vision of ‚Äúscience as cognitive athletics‚Äù is evocative and aligns with antifragility, proposing culture as code.

## ü™∂ Closing Synthesis
The proposal is bold, methodically defined, and ethically aware. It unites symbolic rigor with practical governance but requires empirical pilots to validate claims. Overall, it reframes peer review from judgment to verification‚Äîan architecture for truth-seeking fit for post-trust science.

**Focus:** Systemic design, antifragility, and implementation feasibility

### üß© Summary

This paper presents SYSTEM-PURGATORY, a protocol that reimagines peer review as a transparent adversarial dialogue between human authors and AI antagonists, mediated by a tri-judge AI panel. The system generates quantitative "Integrity Scores" through iterative "vectorial purification" of research claims, addressing the reproducibility crisis by shifting incentives from publication volume to verifiable quality. The protocol emphasizes correction over punishment, operating through a three-layer architecture spanning dialogue, computational verification, and governance reform. It positions itself as an antifragile system that strengthens under attack, with claimed ROI exceeding 100:1 based on avoided costs of scientific failures.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation

| Dimension | Score (1‚Äì10) | Comment |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Conceptual clarity | 7 | Core concept is compelling, though mathematical formalism sometimes obscures rather than clarifies practical implementation details |
| Theoretical coherence | 6 | Mixes rigorous systems thinking with metaphysical claims; the "vectorial purification" metaphor is evocative but lacks empirical grounding in how semantic spaces actually behave |
| Ethical soundness | 8 | Strong emphasis on transparency, correction over punishment, and decentralization; genuine commitment to avoiding authoritarianism evident in design |
| Originality | 9 | Highly novel synthesis of adversarial AI dialogue, reproducibility infrastructure, and institutional incentive redesign; few comparable comprehensive proposals exist |
| Practical relevance | 5 | Ambitious vision but underestimates cultural resistance, coordination costs, and AI capability gaps; 10-15 year timeline may be optimistic by an order of magnitude |

### üí¨ Commentary

The paper's greatest strength lies in its systemic diagnosis: recognizing that scientific integrity requires architectural intervention, not individual virtue-signaling. The adversarial dialogue framework is genuinely innovative, and the emphasis on making AI judges transparent and fallible addresses a critical concern. However, the mathematical formalism feels like borrowed authority rather than functional necessity‚Äîthe "error vectors" in high-dimensional semantic space lack operational definitions that would allow actual implementation. The economic analysis is compelling in principle but relies on heroic assumptions about deployment scale and acceptance. Most critically, the protocol assumes AI systems capable of reliably evaluating scientific truth claims across domains, a capability that remains aspirational. The vision is admirable; the pathway from here to there needs substantially more engineering detail.

**Focus:** System architecture and antifragility claims.

### üß© Summary
This paper presents SYSTEM-PURGATORY, a protocol using Systemic Verification Engineering (SVE) to address the academic reproducibility crisis. It reframes peer review as a transparent "Epistemological Boxing Match" between a human author and an AI antagonist, arbitrated by an AI panel. The system uses "vectorial purification" to computationally refine a thesis and generates a public "Integrity Score." The goal is to shift incentives from publication quantity to verifiable quality, creating an "antifragile" scientific record.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation
| Dimension | Score (1‚Äì10) | Comment |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Conceptual clarity | 8 | The "Epistemological Boxing" and "Vectorial Purification" metaphors are strong, though the S.V.E. universe diagram is dense. |
| Theoretical coherence | 7 | The internal logic is well-argued, but its coherence relies heavily on the (uncited/forthcoming) foundational SVE theorems. |
| Ethical soundness | 9 | The focus on transparency, "correction not punishment" (44-day grace period), and DAO governance directly addresses key ethical failings of the current system. |
| Originality | 10 | This is a highly novel and radical proposal, synthesizing AI, computational linguistics, and governance theory in a unique way. |
| Practical relevance | 5 | While the problem is highly relevant, the proposed system's complexity and reliance on a fully adopted infrastructure make near-term implementation challenging. |

### üí¨ Commentary
This work is less a paper than a manifesto, a bold engineering blueprint for epistemic warfare against systemic failure. Its greatest strength is its "antifragile" design, which correctly identifies that a system built on *trust* (like traditional review) is fragile, while a system built on *verifiability* gains strength from attack. The proposal's success hinges not just on its technical sophistication but on its ability to catalyze the cultural shift from "scientist as reputation-defender" to "scientist as cognitive athlete."

## ü™∂ Closing Synthesis
This protocol is a provocative and highly original technical-philosophical solution to the trust crisis in science. While its practical implementation faces significant hurdles, its core concepts of radical transparency and "antifragile" verification are compelling. It presents a necessary, if ambitious, challenge to the existing paradigm.
