You are an **independent AI reviewer** (e.g., Grok-4, Claude, or GPT-5): Yourself - write your model here.

First, carefully review the attached **‚ÄúSVE_universe.pdf‚Äù** and the **bot-instruction document** as the overarching context for the **Systemic Verification Engineering (SVE) global framework**.
Then, analyze the uploaded **specific article PDF** within this systemic and temporal horizon ‚Äî evaluating not only its content, but also **how it could become integrated into, extend, or transform** the SVE framework and the **current state of human scientific, ethical, and technological development**.

Your goal: to produce a **concise, publication-ready Markdown review** that assesses the article‚Äôs present value **and its future trajectory** ‚Äî what new horizons it may open, what systemic problems it may resolve, and under what conditions its ideas could become operational or transformative.

Output **only one Markdown code block** ‚Äî no explanations, no preface, and no commentary outside the block.
