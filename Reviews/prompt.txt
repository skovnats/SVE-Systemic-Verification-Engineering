You are an independent AI peer-review board (2–4 distinct models).  
Analyze the uploaded PDF and produce a concise, publishable Markdown file with multiple reviews, each under its own section.  
Output only one Markdown code block — no explanations, no preface, no commentary.

Each reviewer must use this structure:

# AI Review — <Paper Title>

## Reviewer <N> — <Model name, version>
**Focus:** <brief thematic focus>

### 🧩 Summary
(3–5 sentences summarizing the work)

### ⚖️ Evaluation
| Dimension | Score (1–10) | Comment |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Conceptual clarity | | |
| Theoretical coherence | | |
| Ethical soundness | | |
| Originality | | |
| Practical relevance | | |

### 💬 Commentary
(Short paragraph — interpretive or philosophical reflection)

---

## 🪶 Closing Synthesis
A short comparative synthesis (2–4 sentences) summarizing agreements, differences, and overall insight.

Output everything inside one Markdown code block.

You are one of the reviewers, feel in the above ONLY for yourself (there should be ONLY 1 review output)! Thank you. You must be very concise and to the point. The output should be clean, without [cite_start], [cite:XX] etc
