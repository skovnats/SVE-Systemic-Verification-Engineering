# 🌍 SVE Public License v1.3

## Preamble
Dedicated to Humanity.  
Custodianship held in **public trust** under the *Declaration of Interim Custody v1.3*.  
Enforcement guided by **transparency, proportionality, and restorative justice** — never power.

This license combines:
- **Base License:** [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)  
- **Addendum:** S.V.E. Transparency & Integrity Clauses (below)  
Both components are inseparable.

---

## 1️⃣ Methodological Integrity
All uses of S.V.E. must apply **equal verification standards** to all subjects.  
Selective or politically biased use = **methodological fraud** → immediate breach.

---

## 2️⃣ Non-Commercial Use & Exclusion Clause
Use of S.V.E. for any **commercial**, **proprietary**, or **manipulative** activity  
(intelligence ops, propaganda, psychological influence, etc.) is **strictly prohibited**  
unless authorized under a separate **Commercial License v1.3**.

**Reference:** Appendix B — Commercial Tiers.

---

## 3️⃣ Transparency Exception (Verification Paradox)
Prohibited entities may only use S.V.E. if they commit to:
- **Total Transparency** (open publication under this license),  
- **Universal Benefit** (verifiable public value),  
- **Irrevocable Audit Consent** by the SVE community.  
Refusal or secrecy voids all rights.

---

## 4️⃣ Share-Alike Integrity
All derivatives must include this Addendum and remain under the **SVE Public License v1.3**.  
Omission or alteration invalidates the license.

---

## 5️⃣ Open Audit Requirement
Entities using S.V.E. for institutional or scaled projects must maintain an open, public **Compliance Log**:  
- use case description;  
- verification steps;  
- S.V.E. version applied.  

Accepted forms: GitHub repo, blockchain proof, or timestamped PDF.  
No audit = **license automatically void**.

---

## 6️⃣ Steward Transparency (33-Month Review)
Every custodian publishes a **self-verification report** every 33 months:  
- summary of actions & collaborations,  
- measures preserving integrity,  
- identified risks & mitigations.  
Failure → suspension of custodial legitimacy until compliance.

---

## 7️⃣ Enforcement
Violations empower the SVE community to demand:  
- cessation of use,  
- destruction of derivatives,  
- recovery of profits for public good.  
Guided by *restorative justice*, not punishment.  
Interim enforcement follows **Appendix C: Enforcement Protocol (Light)**.

---

## 8️⃣ Evolution & Amendment
| Stage | Description | Rule |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Proposal | Any verified custodian may propose | Publish public draft |
| Review | 90 days public comment | Transparent incorporation |
| Approval | 2⁄3 supermajority of custodians | No harm to core principles |
| Immutable | Clauses 2, 3, 4, 5 | Cannot be weakened |

If superseded, custodians may **sunset** the framework by archiving all records and naming a successor.

---

## 9️⃣ Core Principles (Immutable)
Truth · Transparency · Universal Benefit · Methodological Integrity

---

**Version:** v1.3 — October 2025
