# SVE Public License v1.2

## Preamble

This work is dedicated to Humanity and protected by a structure designed for perpetual public service.

Copyright is held collectively by the **SVE DAO**, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

Until the DAO is formally established, all moral and custodial rights are vested in public stewardship under the **Declaration of Interim Custody and Community Stewardship**.

Enforcement is carried out by the DAO itself and by Trusted Enforcer Organizations operating under an irrevocable mandate from the DAO.

This SVE Public License v1.2 consists of two integral components:

### A. The Base License

**Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**

→ https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

### B. The SVE Addendum v1.2 (Mandatory Use Restrictions and Transparency Clause)

The following clauses are inseparable from this license and apply to all uses.

---

## 1. Methodological Integrity (Universal Application)

Any use of the SVE methodology must apply equivalent rigor to all subjects.

Selective or politically biased application constitutes methodological fraud and is strictly prohibited.

---

## 2. Strict Non-Commercial Use

Any direct or indirect commercial exploitation — including the sale of products or services based on this work, use for commercial funding, or incorporation into proprietary systems — is prohibited unless a separate negotiated license is granted by the SVE DAO.

Circumvention through complex corporate or contractual structures is treated as deliberate infringement.

**Commercial license requests:** artiomkovnatsky@pm.me

**Note:** Standardized commercial licensing tiers are available. See **Appendix B: Commercial Licensing Tiers and Package Specifications**.

---

## 3. Prohibition for Intelligence & Manipulation Entities

Absolute prohibition applies to any entity (state, private, NGO, or individual) engaged in intelligence, counter-intelligence, propaganda, psychological operations, or public-consciousness manipulation.

Activity defines the entity.

---

## 4. Exception for Radical Transparency (Verification Paradox)

The prohibition in Clause 3 is lifted only if the entity meets all conditions:

- **Total Transparency:** Immediate public release under SVE PL v1.2.
- **Universal Benefit:** A verifiable objective serving humanity as a whole.
- **Irrevocable Consent:** To audit by the SVE DAO or its designee.

Refusal of audit or secrecy of use constitutes a fundamental breach.

**Note:** The only known way to verify compliance is through the SVE protocol itself.

---

## 5. ShareAlike Includes Addendum

The ShareAlike (SA) clause of the Base License explicitly includes this SVE Addendum.

All derivatives must be licensed under the full **SVE Public License v1.2** (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 + SVE Addendum v1.2).

Separation or omission of the Addendum invalidates the license.

---

## 6. Enforcement & Liability

Violation grants the SVE DAO and its Trusted Enforcers the right to demand:

- cessation of use,
- destruction of derivative materials,
- disgorgement of all profits,
- plus reasonable damages.

Recovered funds shall be directed exclusively toward public benefit as defined by the Author's Declaration.

All enforcement actions are guided by principles of restorative justice and proportional transparency.

**Interim Enforcement:** Until SVE DAO formation, see **Appendix C: Interim Enforcement Protocol**.

---

## 7. Open Audit Requirement (Transparency Clause)

Any entity (individual or institutional) employing the SVE methodology, framework, or derivatives for commercial, institutional, or large-scale purposes must maintain an open audit trail verifiable by the public.

### 7.1 Audit Publication

The entity shall publish an **SVE Compliance Log**, containing:

- description of the use case,
- verification steps taken to preserve methodological integrity,
- and the version of the SVE protocol applied.

### 7.2 Public Accessibility

The audit log must remain permanently accessible through a public repository or distributed ledger verifiable by hash or timestamp.

### 7.3 Condition of License Validity

Failure to maintain or publish the audit trail constitutes a fundamental breach and immediately voids any right to use the SVE methodology.

### 7.4 Commercial Declaration

Any commercial or institutional user must publicly declare their compliance with this transparency clause and reference the SVE Public License v1.2.

---

## 8. Periodic Transparency and Accountability Clause (33-Month Review Rule)

Any individual or collective entity holding moral, custodial, or operational rights related to the SVE framework or its derivatives shall be subject to a periodic public transparency audit.

### 8.1 Audit Frequency

A self-verification and activity report must be published once every **33 months** from the date of receiving stewardship rights.

### 8.2 Audit Content

The report shall include:

- a summary of contributions, collaborations, or decisions involving the SVE ecosystem or related fields,
- measures undertaken to uphold methodological integrity and transparency,
- identification of any conflicts, misuse risks, or deviations, and actions taken to resolve them.

### 8.3 Public Access and Verification

Each audit report shall be permanently available to the public through a verifiable, timestamped record (blockchain, repository, or official SVE registry).

### 8.4 Failure to Comply

Non-publication or falsification of such audit within the prescribed period constitutes a breach of stewardship ethics and results in automatic suspension of custodial legitimacy until compliance is restored.

---

## 9. Amendment and Evolution Protocol

The SVE framework shall evolve through structured community input:

### A. Proposal Mechanism

- Any custodian or verified contributor may propose amendments
- Proposals published to public repository with rationale

### B. Community Review Period

- Minimum 90 days for public comment
- Feedback incorporated via transparent process

### C. Adoption Threshold

- Amendments require supermajority (2/3) of named custodians
- Plus demonstration of no harm to core principles:
  - Truth without compromise
  - Transparency
  - Universal benefit
  - Methodological integrity

### D. Versioning

- All amendments create new version (v1.2 → v1.3, etc.)
- Previous versions remain valid for existing users
- Migration path provided

### E. Core Principles (Immutable)

The following CANNOT be amended:

- Prohibition on intelligence/manipulation use (Clause 3)
- Open Audit Requirement (Clause 7)
- ShareAlike with Addendum (Clause 5)
- Non-commercial without negotiation (Clause 2)

These can only be clarified, never weakened.

### F. Sunset Clause

If SVE framework becomes obsolete or superseded by superior methodology, custodians may vote to "sunset" the framework by publishing:

- Final status report
- Recommendation of successor framework
- Archive of all materials for historical record
