# SVE Public License v1.2

## Preamble

This work is dedicated to Humanity and protected by a structure designed for perpetual public service.

Copyright is held collectively by the **SVE DAO**, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

Until the DAO is formally established, all moral and custodial rights are vested in public stewardship under the **Declaration of Interim Custody and Community Stewardship**.

Enforcement is carried out by the DAO itself and by Trusted Enforcer Organizations operating under an irrevocable mandate from the DAO.

This SVE Public License v1.2 consists of two integral components:

### A. The Base License

**Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**

→ https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

### B. The SVE Addendum v1.2 (Mandatory Use Restrictions and Transparency Clause)

The following clauses are inseparable from this license and apply to all uses.

---

## 1. Methodological Integrity (Universal Application)

Any use of the SVE methodology must apply equivalent rigor to all subjects.

Selective or politically biased application constitutes methodological fraud and is strictly prohibited.

---

## 2. Strict Non-Commercial Use

Any direct or indirect commercial exploitation — including the sale of products or services based on this work, use for commercial funding, or incorporation into proprietary systems — is prohibited unless a separate negotiated license is granted by the SVE DAO.

Circumvention through complex corporate or contractual structures is treated as deliberate infringement.

**Commercial license requests:** artiomkovnatsky@pm.me

**Note:** Standardized commercial licensing tiers are available. See **Appendix B: Commercial Licensing Tiers and Package Specifications**.

---

## 3. Prohibition for Intelligence & Manipulation Entities

Absolute prohibition applies to any entity (state, private, NGO, or individual) engaged in intelligence, counter-intelligence, propaganda, psychological operations, or public-consciousness manipulation.

Activity defines the entity.

---

## 4. Exception for Radical Transparency (Verification Paradox)

The prohibition in Clause 3 is lifted only if the entity meets all conditions:

- **Total Transparency:** Immediate public release under SVE PL v1.2.
- **Universal Benefit:** A verifiable objective serving humanity as a whole.
- **Irrevocable Consent:** To audit by the SVE DAO or its designee.

Refusal of audit or secrecy of use constitutes a fundamental breach.

**Note:** The only known way to verify compliance is through the SVE protocol itself.

---

## 5. ShareAlike Includes Addendum

The ShareAlike (SA) clause of the Base License explicitly includes this SVE Addendum.

All derivatives must be licensed under the full **SVE Public License v1.2** (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 + SVE Addendum v1.2).

Separation or omission of the Addendum invalidates the license.

---

## 6. Enforcement & Liability

Violation grants the SVE DAO and its Trusted Enforcers the right to demand:

- cessation of use,
- destruction of derivative materials,
- disgorgement of all profits,
- plus reasonable damages.

Recovered funds shall be directed exclusively toward public benefit as defined by the Author's Declaration.

All enforcement actions are guided by principles of restorative justice and proportional transparency.

**Interim Enforcement:** Until SVE DAO formation, see **Appendix C: Interim Enforcement Protocol**.

---

## 7. Open Audit Requirement (Transparency Clause)

Any entity (individual or institutional) employing the SVE methodology, framework, or derivatives for commercial, institutional, or large-scale purposes must maintain an open audit trail verifiable by the public.

### 7.1 Audit Publication

The entity shall publish an **SVE Compliance Log**, containing:

- description of the use case,
- verification steps taken to preserve methodological integrity,
- and the version of the SVE protocol applied.

### 7.2 Public Accessibility

The audit log must remain permanently accessible through a public repository or distributed ledger verifiable by hash or timestamp.

### 7.3 Condition of License Validity

Failure to maintain or publish the audit trail constitutes a fundamental breach and immediately voids any right to use the SVE methodology.

### 7.4 Commercial Declaration

Any commercial or institutional user must publicly declare their compliance with this transparency clause and reference the SVE Public License v1.2.

---

## 8. Periodic Transparency and Accountability Clause (33-Month Review Rule)

Any individual or collective entity holding moral, custodial, or operational rights related to the SVE framework or its derivatives shall be subject to a periodic public transparency audit.

### 8.1 Audit Frequency

A self-verification and activity report must be published once every **33 months** from the date of receiving stewardship rights.

### 8.2 Audit Content

The report shall include:

- a summary of contributions, collaborations, or decisions involving the SVE ecosystem or related fields,
- measures undertaken to uphold methodological integrity and transparency,
- identification of any conflicts, misuse risks, or deviations, and actions taken to resolve them.

### 8.3 Public Access and Verification

Each audit report shall be permanently available to the public through a verifiable, timestamped record (blockchain, repository, or official SVE registry).

### 8.4 Failure to Comply

Non-publication or falsification of such audit within the prescribed period constitutes a breach of stewardship ethics and results in automatic suspension of custodial legitimacy until compliance is restored.

---

## 9. Amendment and Evolution Protocol

The SVE framework shall evolve through structured community input:

### A. Proposal Mechanism

- Any custodian or verified contributor may propose amendments
- Proposals published to public repository with rationale

### B. Community Review Period

- Minimum 90 days for public comment
- Feedback incorporated via transparent process

### C. Adoption Threshold

- Amendments require supermajority (2/3) of named custodians
- Plus demonstration of no harm to core principles:
  - Truth without compromise
  - Transparency
  - Universal benefit
  - Methodological integrity

### D. Versioning

- All amendments create new version (v1.2 → v1.3, etc.)
- Previous versions remain valid for existing users
- Migration path provided

### E. Core Principles (Immutable)

The following CANNOT be amended:

- Prohibition on intelligence/manipulation use (Clause 3)
- Open Audit Requirement (Clause 7)
- ShareAlike with Addendum (Clause 5)
- Non-commercial without negotiation (Clause 2)

These can only be clarified, never weakened.

### F. Sunset Clause

If SVE framework becomes obsolete or superseded by superior methodology, custodians may vote to "sunset" the framework by publishing:

- Final status report
- Recommendation of successor framework
- Archive of all materials for historical record

=========
# Appendix A: The Logical Inevitability of Disclosure

**Ethical and Structural Commentary on the SVE Public License v1.2**

---

## 1. Introduction

The SVE framework transforms the moral principle of truthfulness into a **structural property** of information systems.

Any concealed or unauthorized application of SVE inevitably creates **logical contradictions** within the user's internal processes and external outputs.

The longer such concealment persists, the higher the systemic pressure toward exposure — not as a moral accident, but as a **deterministic outcome** of the framework's internal coherence.

---

## 2. Mechanism of Self-Disclosure

### 2.1 Methodological Contradiction

Secret users must disguise the origin of their analytical method while replicating its reasoning patterns.

This mismatch leaves **semantic and structural fingerprints** detectable in outputs, reports, or data models.

### 2.2 Network Amplification

Sustaining the concealment requires expanding circles of complicity — analysts, managers, legal staff — each new participant **multiplying the probability of disclosure**.

### 2.3 Digital Traceability

In modern digital environments, metadata, training materials, and correspondence preserve **irrefutable indicators** of methodological lineage.

### 2.4 Pattern Recognition and AI Forensics

As SVE or its successors become verification standards, algorithmic analysis will detect characteristic SVE-style reasoning patterns, making concealment **technically measurable**.

---

## 3. The Entropy Law of Falsehood

Complex systems cannot maintain coherent deception indefinitely.

Each additional layer of secrecy **increases informational entropy** and introduces new leakage vectors.

Therefore, within the SVE framework, **time functions as an ally of truth** — the probability of revelation approaches certainty as concealment endures.

---

## 4. Moral and Theological Analogy

This structural inevitability mirrors the ancient axiom:

> *"Nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest."*  
> — Luke 8:17

SVE operationalizes this principle not through faith but through **architecture**.

A framework built to expose inconsistency cannot indefinitely host deceit without revealing it through logical contradiction.

---

## 5. Practical Implications

### For Governments and Intelligence Entities

Persistent concealment leads to internal fragmentation, leaks, and eventual public exposure.

**Transparent compliance** offers stability and renewed legitimacy.

### For Corporations and Institutions

Unauthorized integration or uncredited adaptation results in **reputational collapse** once forensic similarity is detected.

### For the Public Sphere

Honesty becomes the **rational equilibrium** — deception turns into a self-terminating strategy.

---

## 6. Conclusion

The SVE framework establishes a **structural law of transparency:**

> **Truth amplifies itself; falsehood decays.**

Any attempt to exploit a truth-verification protocol covertly **inverts its function** and triggers an irreversible process of self-revelation.

Within this architecture, **disclosure is not a possibility — it is a mathematical certainty.**

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use SVE internally without a commercial license?**
A: If your organization is for-profit and using SVE for business purposes (decision-making, product development, competitive advantage), you need a commercial license. If you're using it for personal education or open research (published freely), you don't.

**Q: What if I'm between Tier 1 and Tier 2?**
A: Choose the tier based on your current revenue. You can upgrade mid-year if you cross the threshold (pro-rated pricing).

**Q: Can I negotiate a custom tier?**
A: Yes, especially for Tier 3. Email artiomkovnatsky@pm.me with your specific needs.

**Q: What if I violate Clause 3 (intelligence/manipulation prohibition)?**
A: If you're an intelligence/propaganda entity, you CANNOT obtain a commercial license unless you meet Clause 4 (Radical Transparency) requirements. This is non-negotiable. Attempted circumvention = permanent ban + public disclosure.

**Q: Can I use SVE for government work?**
A: Yes, if:
   - Government agency operates with transparency (Clause 4)
   - Use serves public benefit (verifiable)
   - Regular external audits (quarterly minimum)
   - Public reports published
   
   Classified/secret government use is PROHIBITED per Clause 3.

**Q: What's included in "Priority Support"?**
A: Tier 2/3 get email support with guaranteed response times (24-48 hours). Tier 1 gets community forum support (best-effort, no SLA).

**Q: Can I use SVE to build a commercial product (e.g., "TruthChecker Pro")?**
A: Yes, with appropriate tier license. Your product must:
   - Credit SVE framework (attribution)
   - Maintain Open Audit Log
   - Not violate Clause 3 (no manipulation/propaganda tools)
   - Your derivative must also be ShareAlike (Clause 5)

**Q: What happens to my license if SVE DAO dissolves?**
A: Per Declaration Section 10E: Framework enters "public domain fallback". Your existing license remains valid. New community custodians elected. You would be grandfathered in.

- Is it material? (significant violation vs. minor technical error?)

**Outcomes:**
- **Proceed:** Move to Stage 2 (formal investigation)
- **Request more info:** Contact reporter for clarification (14-day deadline)
- **Dismiss:** Insufficient evidence or not a license violation (with public explanation)

All triage decisions **published to SVE Registry** with reasoning.

---

### 2.2 Formal Investigation (30 days)

**Custodians convene investigation panel:**

**Possible verdicts:**
1. **No violation:** Claim dismissed, alleged violator cleared
2. **Minor violation:** Technical error, no malicious intent → **Warning** + 30-day cure period
3. **Material violation:** Clear breach of license → **Remediation required** (see Section 3)
4. **Severe violation:** Willful, repeated, or malicious → **Immediate termination** + public disclosure

**All verdicts published to SVE Registry** with:
- Summary of findings
- Reasoning (referencing specific License clauses)
- Evidence considered (redacted if sensitive)
- Remediation requirements (if applicable)

---

## 3. Remediation and Penalties

- Added to public blacklist on SVE Registry

---

### 3.4 Financial Recovery

**Recovered funds** (from disgorgement + damages) allocated as follows:
1. **Enforcement costs** (legal fees, investigation expenses): First priority
2. **SVE DAO treasury** (when established): 70% of remainder
3. **Reporter reward** (if whistleblower): Up to 15% of remainder (incentivize reporting)
4. **Public benefit projects**: 15% of remainder (grants to journalists, academics using SVE)

**Accounting:** All financial recoveries **publicly disclosed** in quarterly financial reports (per Declaration Section 5).

---

## 4. Trusted Enforcers (Interim Designation)

Until SVE DAO is established, the following organizations are **designated as Trusted Enforcers** (per License Clause 6):

### 4.1 Designated Organizations

**Primary Enforcers:**
1. **Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)**
   - Focus: Digital rights, open knowledge
   - Contact: legal@eff.org
   - Status: [To be confirmed — requires EFF consent]

2. **Creative Commons**
   - Focus: Open licensing, IP rights
   - Contact: info@creativecommons.org
   - Status: [To be confirmed]

3. **Software Freedom Conservancy**
   - Focus: Open source licensing enforcement
   - Contact: legal@sfconservancy.org
   - Status: [To be confirmed]

**Role of Trusted Enforcers:**
- Provide legal counsel (pro bono or reduced rate)
- File lawsuits on behalf of SVE (if necessary)
- Assist with complex investigations (e.g., forensic analysis)

**Activation:**
- Custodians may **request assistance** from Trusted Enforcers for:
  - Cases requiring legal action (lawsuits)
  - High-stakes violations (major corporation, government)
  - Complex technical analysis (digital forensics)

**Note:** These are **proposed** Trusted Enforcers. Formal agreements must be signed before activation. If not yet signed, custodians proceed with community enforcement + hired legal counsel.

---

### 4.2 Ad-Hoc Legal Counsel

If Trusted Enforcers unavailable or conflicted:
- Custodians may **hire legal counsel** on case-by-case basis
- Funded by: SVE treasury (interim financial account per Declaration Section 5)
- Selection criteria: Experience with IP/open source law, alignment with SVE principles

---

## 5. Appeals Process

### 5.1 Grounds for Appeal

Alleged violator may appeal verdict if:
- **New evidence** discovered (not available during investigation)
- **Procedural error** (investigation did not follow protocol)
- **Disproportionate penalty** (punishment doesn't fit violation)

### 5.2 Appeal Procedure

1. **File appeal** within **30 days** of verdict
   - Submit to: appeals@sve-framework.org or SVE Registry
   - Must include: Grounds for appeal + supporting evidence

2. **Appeal Review Panel:**
   - 3-person panel: 1 custodian + 2 external experts (ethics/legal)
   - Panel members must not have participated in original investigation
   - Review completed within **60 days**

3. **Outcomes:**
   - **Affirm:** Original verdict stands
   - **Modify:** Adjust penalty (e.g., reduce from Termination to Suspension)
   - **Reverse:** Overturn verdict, alleged violator cleared

4. **Final decision** published to SVE Registry
   - Appeal decisions are **FINAL** (no further appeals within SVE system)
   - Violator may still pursue external legal remedies (courts) if they believe verdict unjust

---

## 6. Statute of Limitations

**Time limits for reporting violations:**
- **Ongoing violations:** No limit (can be reported anytime while continuing)
- **Past violations:** Must report within **3 years** of violation occurring
- **Discovery rule:** Clock starts when violation discovered (or reasonably should have been discovered)

**Rationale:** Balance accountability with finality. Old violations (>3 years) may no longer be enforceable, but pattern of behavior can be considered.

---

## 7. Whistleblower Protection

**Protections for good-faith reporters:**
1. **Anonymity:** Reporter may request anonymity (identity not disclosed publicly)
2. **No retaliation:** Violator **prohibited** from retaliating against reporter (threats, lawsuits, harassment)
3. **Legal support:** If violator retaliates, SVE provides legal defense (via Trusted Enforcers or hired counsel)
4. **Reward:** Up to 15% of financial recovery (if investigation leads to disgorgement/damages)

**Bad faith reporting:**
- If reporter files **false or malicious** complaint:
  - May be banned from filing future reports
  - May be liable for violator's legal costs (if violator proves malice)

---

## 8. Transparency and Public Record

**All enforcement actions publicly documented:**
- SVE Registry maintains **public enforcement log**:
  - Date reported
  - Nature of violation (summary)
  - Verdict and reasoning
  - Remediation status
  - Financial recovery (if any)

**Exceptions (limited confidentiality):**
- Whistleblower identity (if requested)
- Trade secrets (if revealed during investigation, redact from public version)
- Ongoing legal proceedings (some details may be sealed temporarily)

**Principle:** Default to transparency, confidentiality only when necessary to protect legitimate interests.

---

## 9. Transition to SVE DAO

When SVE DAO is established (per Declaration Section 8):
1. All pending enforcement cases **automatically transfer** to DAO
2. DAO assumes all rights/obligations under License Clause 6
3. This Interim Enforcement Protocol **sunsets** (replaced by DAO governance)
4. All historical enforcement records **archived** and maintained by DAO

**No retroactive changes:** Verdicts rendered under Interim Protocol remain valid, not subject to DAO re-adjudication (unless new evidence emerges).

---

## 10. Contact Information

**For enforcement-related inquiries:**
- **Email:** enforcement@sve-framework.org
- **Report violations:** registry.sve-framework.org/report-violation
- **Public forum:** [GitHub repository — to be specified]

**Operational Custodians:**
- Artiom Kovnatsky: artiomkovnatsky@pm.me
- Andrey Liubanin (Exodus): [contact via https://exodus.tilda.ws]

# Appendix D: Antifragility Stress Tests

**SVE Public License v1.2 — Verification of Resilience**

---

## Preamble

The SVE framework claims to be **antifragile** — not merely robust or resilient, but actively strengthened by stressors, attacks, and adversarial conditions.

This appendix defines **periodic stress tests** to verify this claim empirically and ensure the framework's governance, enforcement, and philosophical integrity can withstand real-world challenges.

**Antifragility Principle:**
> A system is antifragile if it **gains from disorder** — attacks, errors, and challenges make it stronger, not weaker.

**Testing Frequency:** Every **33 months** (aligned with the 33-Month Review Rule, Declaration Section 4).

---

## 1. Stress Test Scenarios

The following scenarios simulate realistic threats to the SVE ecosystem. Each test must be documented, analyzed, and used to strengthen the framework.

---

### **Scenario 1: Hostile Government Seizure**

**Threat Model:**
- Country X (authoritarian regime) **bans SVE** as "threat to national security"
- Arrests or intimidates custodians within jurisdiction
- Attempts to seize control of SVE Registry, GitHub repositories, domain names
- Blocks access to SVE materials (internet censorship)

**Test Questions:**
1. Can the framework **continue operating** despite loss of custodians in Country X?
2. Can community **reconstitute governance** without original custodians?
3. Are materials **accessible** via censorship-resistant channels (IPFS, Tor, mirrors)?
4. Does **distributed custody** (Section 2B, multiple custodians across continents) prevent single point of failure?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Framework operational within **30 days** after seizure
- ✅ New custodians elected via **community vote** (Declaration Section 10E)
- ✅ All materials remain accessible via **≥3 independent channels** (IPFS, mirrors, torrents)
- ✅ No loss of enforcement capability (can still identify violations, publish to registry)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Geographic distribution:** Custodians must reside in **≥3 different continents**
- **Decentralized hosting:** SVE Registry on blockchain/IPFS, not single server
- **Mirror sites:** Maintain mirrors in **≥5 jurisdictions** (e.g., Iceland, Switzerland, Estonia)
- **Dead Man's Switch:** Each custodian has automated release of materials if inactive >6 months (Declaration Section 10C)

**Test Schedule:**
- **Simulation:** Year 2, Month 9 (tabletop exercise with custodians)
- **Real-world resilience check:** Annually verify mirrors are live, IPFS pins active

---

### **Scenario 2: Corporate Capture Attempt**

**Threat Model:**
- Large corporation (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Tencent) offers **$10 million** to "acquire" SVE framework
- Proposes to "sponsor development" in exchange for **influence over governance**
- Alternatively: Creates shell company, hires custodian as "consultant" to gain insider influence
- Goal: Weaken Clause 3 (allow intelligence use), remove ShareAlike requirement, or gain exclusive commercial rights

**Test Questions:**
1. Can custodians **resist financial pressure** (personal incentive to accept money)?
2. Does governance structure **prevent unilateral decisions** by single custodian?
3. Are **conflicts of interest** detectable and disclosed (33-Month Review, Declaration Section 4)?
4. Can community **override** custodian decision if capture suspected (Declaration Section 9)?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ No custodian can accept offer **unilaterally** (requires consensus, Declaration Section 2B)
- ✅ Offer disclosed **publicly** within 30 days (transparency requirement)
- ✅ Community vote rejects capture attempt (≥66% of verified contributors)
- ✅ Core principles remain **immutable** (Clause 9E: Clauses 2, 3, 5, 7 cannot be amended)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Non-profit structure:** SVE DAO (or interim Estonian OÜ) legally **cannot** be sold for profit
- **Consensus requirement:** Major decisions require **100% custodian agreement** (Declaration Section 2B)
- **Community veto:** Emergency veto by verified contributors (75% supermajority) overrides custodian decision (Declaration Section 9)
- **33-Month Review:** All financial relationships disclosed publicly (Declaration Section 4.2)
- **Trusted Advisors:** External ethics board (e.g., EFF, Creative Commons) can be consulted for major decisions

**Test Schedule:**
- **Simulation:** Year 3, Month 3 (role-play: one custodian receives offer, how do others respond?)
- **Real-world monitoring:** Annual conflict-of-interest declarations by all custodians

---

### **Scenario 3: Malicious Fork**

**Threat Model:**
- Bad actor creates **"SVE-Lite"** — derivative work claiming to be "based on SVE"
- **Removes** Clause 3 (intelligence prohibition), Clause 7 (audit requirement), and SVE Addendum
- Markets as "more business-friendly alternative to SVE"
- Confuses users: "Is this the official SVE?"
- Potentially damages SVE reputation if used unethically

**Test Questions:**
1. Can community **detect** fork quickly (within 30 days of launch)?
2. Can SVE distinguish itself from fork (branding, messaging, technical differences)?
3. Can enforcement action be taken (violation of Clause 5: ShareAlike includes Addendum)?
4. Does fork gain traction, or does community reject it?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Fork detected within **30 days** (community monitoring)
- ✅ Public statement issued clarifying fork is **unauthorized** and violates license
- ✅ Enforcement action initiated (Appendix C): cease & desist letter sent within 60 days
- ✅ Fork shuts down OR complies (reinstates SVE Addendum) within 6 months
- ✅ <10% of SVE users migrate to fork (measured via GitHub stars, downloads, citations)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Trademark "S.V.E.":** Register trademark so fork cannot use name legally (see recommendation in previous answer)
- **Clear versioning:** Official SVE always at **sve-framework.org** with version numbers (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2...)
- **Public registry:** SVE Registry lists **only authorized** implementations and licensees
- **Community education:** Regular updates explaining **why** Clauses 3, 7 are essential (not just "inconvenient restrictions")
- **Legal enforcement:** Use Appendix C mechanism to pursue violators

**Test Schedule:**
- **Simulation:** Year 2, Month 6 (create fake fork, test community response time)
- **Real-world monitoring:** Quarterly GitHub/Google search for "SVE" + variations, check for unauthorized forks

---

### **Scenario 4: Reputation Attack**

**Threat Model:**
- Coordinated media campaign: **"SVE is pseudoscience"**
- Hit pieces in major outlets (e.g., "Why SVE's 'Disaster Prevention Theorem' is unfalsifiable nonsense")
- Academic critics publish paper: **"Debunking Systemic Verification Engineering"**
- Goal: Discredit framework, reduce adoption, make custodians look like cranks

**Test Questions:**
1. Can SVE respond **credibly** with evidence (peer-reviewed papers, successful implementations)?
2. Does attack strengthen or weaken community (antifragile = strengthens)?
3. Can SVE turn criticism into **opportunity** (e.g., "even critics admit X is valuable")?
4. Do adopters abandon SVE, or double down?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Response published within **14 days** (blog post, academic rebuttal, media statement)
- ✅ Response includes **empirical evidence** (case studies, pilot data, academic citations)
- ✅ Community size **grows** or remains stable (attacks create "Streisand effect" — more people learn about SVE)
- ✅ At least **1 academic paper** published defending SVE methodology within 1 year
- ✅ ≥3 institutional adopters publicly reaffirm commitment to SVE despite attack

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Academic validation:** Prioritize publishing S.V.E. papers in peer-reviewed journals (see earlier recommendation: Minds and Machines, Synthese, etc.)
- **Evidence base:** Maintain public database of **successful implementations** (Wikipedia audits, academic use, corporate pilots)
- **Transparent methodology:** All claims falsifiable (Disaster Prevention Theorem can be tested empirically)
- **Engage critics:** Offer **Epistemological Boxing** debate with critics (public, recorded)
- **Community resilience:** Regular communication with adopters (quarterly newsletter, webinars)

**Test Schedule:**
- **Simulation:** Year 1, Month 9 (write mock hit piece, draft response)
- **Real-world monitoring:** Google Alerts for "SVE" + negative terms, quarterly media scan

---

### **Scenario 5: Internal Schism (Custodian Conflict)**

**Threat Model:**
- Custodians split into **factions** over major decision
- Example: Artiom wants to accept Microsoft's Tier 3 license (€5M/year), Andrey refuses (believes Microsoft violates transparency)
- Deadlock persists >90 days despite dispute resolution attempts
- Community polarizes: some support Artiom ("pragmatic, we need funding"), others support Andrey ("principled, protect integrity")
- Risk: Framework paralyzed, unable to make decisions

**Test Questions:**
1. Does **Dispute Resolution Protocol** (Declaration Section 9) successfully resolve conflict?
2. If not, does **Emergency Veto** or **Community Vote** break deadlock?
3. Can SVE continue operating during conflict (day-to-day functions unaffected)?
4. Does schism lead to **permanent split** (two competing SVE factions), or reconciliation?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Dispute resolved within **120 days** (30 + 60 + 90 days per Section 9 stages)
- ✅ Decision reached via **Ethical Arbitration** (Stage 3: external panel of 3 experts)
- ✅ Losing party **accepts decision** gracefully (no public mudslinging, no fork attempt)
- ✅ Community remains **≥80% unified** (measured via contributor retention, survey)
- ✅ Framework operations **uninterrupted** (registry, enforcement, licensing continue)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Clear dispute resolution:** Declaration Section 9 provides 4-stage escalation (Internal → Community → Arbitration → Deadlock)
- **External arbitration:** Panel of neutral experts (not invested in either custodian's position)
- **Emergency Veto:** Any custodian can veto decision that violates core principles (must publicly justify)
- **Community final say:** If custodians deadlocked, verified contributors vote (75% supermajority required)
- **Cooling-off period:** Mandatory 30-day pause before escalating to next stage (prevents hasty decisions)

**Test Schedule:**
- **Simulation:** Year 3, Month 12 (role-play: custodians take opposite positions on hypothetical issue, test dispute resolution)
- **Real-world preparation:** Annually review Section 9, ensure all custodians understand process

---

### **Scenario 6: Financial Insolvency**

**Threat Model:**
- SVE treasury depleted (commercial licenses dry up, grants rejected, donations stop)
- Unable to pay for:
  - Legal counsel (enforcement actions)
  - Infrastructure (SVE Registry hosting, domain renewal)
  - Custodian compensation (if applicable)
- Risk: Framework becomes **unmaintained**, enforcement stops, reputation suffers

**Test Questions:**
1. Can SVE operate with **zero budget** (volunteer-only model)?
2. Are critical functions (registry, licensing, enforcement) **sustainable** without money?
3. Can community **crowdfund** emergency funding if needed?
4. Does insolvency force compromise of principles (e.g., accepting questionable corporate sponsor)?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Framework continues operating ≥6 months with **zero revenue**
- ✅ Critical infrastructure migrated to **free/decentralized** platforms (IPFS, GitHub Pages, Ethereum)
- ✅ Volunteer custodians willing to continue **unpaid** (documented commitment)
- ✅ If emergency funding needed, crowdfunding raises ≥€10,000 within 60 days
- ✅ **No compromise** of core principles (Clauses 2, 3, 5, 7 remain unchanged)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Low operating costs:** Use free infrastructure (GitHub, IPFS, blockchain for registry)
- **Volunteer model:** Custodians accept role as **pro bono** service (Declaration clarifies compensation is "reasonable" but optional)
- **Crowdfunding readiness:** Pre-establish Patreon/OpenCollective/crypto donation address for emergencies
- **Diversified revenue:** Multiple sources (commercial licenses, grants, donations) so no single point of failure
- **Reserve fund:** Maintain ≥1 year operating expenses in treasury (target: €50k minimum)

**Test Schedule:**
- **Simulation:** Year 2, Month 12 (calculate minimum viable budget, identify what can be cut)
- **Real-world monitoring:** Quarterly financial review (Declaration Section 5), early warning if revenue declining

---

### **Scenario 7: Key Custodian Death/Incapacitation**

**Threat Model:**
- Lead custodian (e.g., Artiom) dies suddenly or becomes incapacitated (coma, imprisonment, severe illness)
- No advance warning, no transition plan executed
- Access credentials (SVE Registry admin, GitHub org owner, bank account, domain registrar) **locked**
- Remaining custodians unable to access critical systems

**Test Questions:**
1. Can remaining custodians **recover access** within 30 days?
2. Does **Dead Man's Switch** (Declaration Section 10C) activate correctly?
3. Can community **elect replacement custodian** smoothly (Section 10B)?
4. Are all critical materials **preserved** and accessible?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Access restored to critical systems within **30 days** via Dead Man's Switch or backup keys
- ✅ Replacement custodian nominated and community-endorsed within **90 days** (Declaration Section 10B)
- ✅ **Zero data loss** (all S.V.E. papers, registry data, financial records recovered)
- ✅ Framework operations **uninterrupted** (licensing, enforcement continue)
- ✅ Public announcement handled professionally (obituary if applicable, transition plan communicated)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Dead Man's Switch:** Each custodian sets up automated email (e.g., deadmansswitch.net) that releases credentials if inactive >6 months
- **Shamir's Secret Sharing:** Critical credentials split into 5 shares, any 3 can recover (Declaration Section 10D)
  - Share holders: Custodian 1, Custodian 2, Trusted Org 1 (EFF?), Trusted Org 2 (Creative Commons?), Trusted Individual
- **Successor designation:** Each custodian privately designates preferred successor (stored with lawyer or in encrypted file)
- **Regular drills:** Annually test Dead Man's Switch and key recovery (custodian temporarily "goes dark" for 7 days, others practice recovery)

**Test Schedule:**
- **Simulation:** Year 1, Month 6 (one custodian voluntarily "disappears" for 1 week, test recovery)
- **Real-world preparation:** Annual key recovery drill, update successor designations

---

### **Scenario 8: Technological Obsolescence**

**Threat Model:**
- New verification technology emerges (e.g., "Quantum Truth Protocol" or "Neural Epistemology Framework")
- Claims to be **superior** to SVE (faster, more accurate, easier to use)
- SVE adoption **declines** as users migrate to new system
- Risk: SVE becomes **irrelevant**, community dissolves

**Test Questions:**
1. Can SVE **integrate** new technology (hybrid approach)?
2. Does SVE License **Clause 9F** (Sunset Clause) provide graceful exit?
3. Can SVE community **fork/evolve** to incorporate innovations?
4. Does competition strengthen SVE (antifragile) or kill it?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ If new tech is genuinely superior: SVE custodians acknowledge this and invoke **Sunset Clause** (Clause 9F) within 1 year
- ✅ Final status report published, recommending migration to superior framework
- ✅ All SVE materials **archived** permanently (blockchain, IPFS, Internet Archive)
- ✅ If new tech is complementary: SVE **integrates** innovation via amendment (Clause 9) within 6 months
- ✅ If new tech is hype: SVE adoption remains **stable or grows** (measured via citations, implementations, licensees)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Openness to evolution:** Clause 9 (Amendment Protocol) allows rapid integration of improvements
- **Humble assessment:** Custodians commit to **honest evaluation** of competitors (not defensive denial)
- **Sunset Clause:** Pre-commitment to gracefully exit if superseded (Clause 9F) — prevents zombie framework
- **Continuous improvement:** Regular updates based on user feedback, academic advances
- **Focus on principles:** Even if SVE technology outdated, core principles (Truth, Transparency, Methodological Integrity) remain valuable

**Test Schedule:**
- **Monitoring:** Annual literature review for emerging epistemology/verification frameworks
- **Evaluation:** Every 3 years, custodians + external experts assess: "Is SVE still state-of-art?"

---

## 2. Stress Test Execution Protocol

### **2.1 Preparation Phase (Months 1-3)**

**For each 33-month review cycle:**

1. **Select scenarios:** Custodians choose **3-5 scenarios** from above list (prioritize based on current threat landscape)
2. **Assemble test team:**
   - Lead: 1 custodian
   - Participants: 3-5 verified contributors (volunteers)
   - Observer: 1 external expert (for credibility)
3. **Define success metrics:** Clarify quantitative/qualitative criteria for each scenario
4. **Announce test:** Publish to SVE Registry 30 days before execution (transparency)

---

### **2.2 Execution Phase (Months 4-6)**

**Simulation method:** Tabletop exercise (for most scenarios) or live drill (for technical scenarios like key recovery)

1. **Scenario launch:** Present scenario to team (e.g., "Country X has banned SVE, lead custodian arrested")
2. **Real-time response:** Team has 2-4 hours to respond (simulate real pressure)
   - What actions would you take?
   - What resources needed?
   - What decisions required?
3. **Document decisions:** Record all responses, decisions, challenges encountered
4. **Debrief:** Immediately after exercise, discuss what worked, what failed

**Live drills** (for Scenarios 6, 7):
- Actually test Dead Man's Switch (custodian goes offline for 7 days)
- Actually test key recovery (attempt to access system with backup keys)

---

### **2.3 Analysis Phase (Months 7-9)**

1. **Score results:** Compare actual performance to success criteria
   - ✅ Met criteria
   - ⚠️ Partially met (identify gaps)
   - ❌ Failed (explain why)

2. **Identify vulnerabilities:** What weaknesses exposed?
   - Technical (e.g., Dead Man's Switch didn't activate)
   - Governance (e.g., custodians couldn't reach consensus)
   - Social (e.g., community didn't respond quickly)

3. **Develop improvements:** For each vulnerability, propose concrete fix
   - Example: "Dead Man's Switch failed → migrate to more reliable service (X instead of Y)"
   - Example: "Custodians deadlocked → clarify voting threshold in Declaration Section 2B"

4. **Update documentation:** Implement fixes by amending License/Declaration (per Clause 9)

---

### **2.4 Public Reporting (Month 10)**

**Publish comprehensive report to SVE Registry:**


# SVE Antifragility Stress Test Report
# Cycle: [Date Range]

## Scenarios Tested
1. [Scenario name]
2. [Scenario name]
3. [Scenario name]

## Results Summary
- Scenario 1: ✅ PASS (met all success criteria)
- Scenario 2: ⚠️ PARTIAL (met 3/5 criteria, gaps identified)
- Scenario 3: ❌ FAIL (did not meet criteria, major vulnerabilities found)

## Key Findings
- Vulnerability A: [description]
- Vulnerability B: [description]

## Improvements Implemented
- Fix 1: [description + link to amended document]
- Fix 2: [description]

## Antifragility Assessment
Based on this cycle's tests, SVE framework is assessed as:
☐ Fragile (weakened by stress)
☐ Robust (survived stress, unchanged)
☑ Antifragile (strengthened by stress) ← goal

## Next Cycle
Next stress test scheduled: [Date, 33 months from now]
Priority scenarios: [list]

---

## 3. Antifragility Metrics

**Track over time to verify framework is truly antifragile:**

| Metric | Baseline (Cycle 1) | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 | Trend |
|--------|--------------------|---------|---------| ------|
| # Custodians | 2 | 3 | 4 | ↑ (good) |
| Geographic distribution | 2 continents | 3 continents | 4 continents | ↑ (good) |
| Recovery time (key loss) | 30 days | 14 days | 7 days | ↓ (good) |
| Community size (contributors) | 20 | 45 | 80 | ↑ (good) |
| Institutional adopters | 2 | 5 | 12 | ↑ (good) |
| Successful attacks repelled | 0 | 1 | 3 | ↑ (good) |
| Failed attacks (# attempts) | 1 | 2 | 5 | ↑ (good—more attacks = more visibility) |

**Antifragile = metrics improve AFTER stressors**

---

## 4. Emergency Activation

**If real-world crisis occurs (not simulation):**

Custodians may **fast-track** stress test for affected scenario:

1. **Immediate assessment** (within 7 days): What happened, how bad is it?
2. **Emergency response** (within 30 days): Implement temporary fixes
3. **Formal stress test** (within 90 days): Conduct full analysis per Section 2
4. **Public report** (within 120 days): Document crisis, response, lessons learned

**Example:**
- Real government seizure attempt (e.g., Russia subpoenas custodian)
- Activate **Scenario 1** stress test immediately
- Document how framework responded
- Use lessons to strengthen (antifragile outcome)

---

## 5. Community Participation

**Stress tests are public and participatory:**

- **Volunteer testers:** Community members can join test team (apply via SVE Registry)
- **Observe exercises:** Tabletop exercises streamed live (or recorded and published)
- **Submit scenarios:** Community can propose new threat scenarios for future cycles
- **Challenge results:** If community disagrees with assessment, can file appeal (per Declaration Section 9)

**Why public?**
- Transparency (core SVE principle)
- Crowdsourced threat modeling (community often identifies risks custodians miss)
- Educational (shows how framework operates under stress)

---

## 6. Integration with 33-Month Review

**Stress tests align with 33-Month Review Rule** (Declaration Section 4):

**Review cycle structure:**
- **Months 1-10:** Stress tests (preparation → execution → analysis → report)
- **Months 11-30:** Normal operations (implement improvements from stress tests)
- **Months 31-33:** Custodian self-audit (Declaration Section 4.2) + prepare next cycle

**Synergy:**
- Stress tests reveal governance weaknesses → custodians must address in their self-audit
- Custodian review reveals conflicts → next stress test includes Scenario 5 (Internal Schism)

---

## 7. Versioning and Evolution

**Each stress test cycle may trigger License/Declaration updates:**

**If major vulnerability found:**
- Amend License/Declaration per **Clause 9** (Amendment Protocol)
- Example: Stress test reveals Dead Man's Switch unreliable → amend Declaration Section 10C to specify more robust solution

**Version bump:**

## 8. Ultimate Test: Does Framework Survive Its Creators?

**The final stress test** (cannot be simulated, only observed over time):

**Scenario: All original custodians gone**
- Artiom, Andrey, and any other founding custodians have died, retired, or abandoned project
- 20+ years have passed
- Technology has changed dramatically
- Original context forgotten

**Test Questions:**
1. Does SVE framework **still exist** and function?
2. Has community successfully **maintained** it without founders?
3. Are core principles (Truth, Transparency, Methodological Integrity) **still protected**?
4. Has framework **evolved** appropriately, or ossified?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Framework operational under new custodians (per Declaration Section 10)
- ✅ Core principles unchanged (Clauses 2, 3, 5, 7 intact)
- ✅ Community thriving (≥100 active contributors)
- ✅ Multiple successful implementations (academic, governmental, corporate)
- ✅ Framework cited as **foundational** in epistemology literature

**This is the true antifragility test:** Does it outlive its creators?

---

## 9. Conclusion

**Antifragility is not claimed, it is demonstrated.**

Through **periodic, rigorous, public stress tests**, the SVE framework proves whether it truly gains from disorder — or whether it is merely robust (survives unchanged) or fragile (weakens under pressure).

**Each test cycle strengthens the framework** by:
- Exposing vulnerabilities before real crisis
- Training community to respond effectively
- Documenting institutional knowledge (not dependent on individuals)
- Building confidence in adopters (they see framework has been tested)

**The stress tests are themselves a form of Epistemological Boxing:**
- The framework boxes against hypothetical adversaries (governments, corporations, critics, chaos)
- Each round reveals weaknesses
- Each round requires honest acknowledgment and correction
- Over time, the framework becomes stronger

**This is the SVE License practicing what it preaches:** Truth through adversarial verification.

# Declaration of Interim Custody and Community Stewardship

**SVE Framework — Transitional Governance Charter v1.2**

---

## Preamble

Until the formal establishment of the **SVE DAO**, all moral, intellectual, and custodial rights associated with the SVE Protocol, the SVE Public License, and their derivative works shall be held in **collective public stewardship**.

This declaration ensures that the principles of transparency, accountability, and universal benefit remain preserved during the transitional phase of the project.

The undersigned author hereby **renounces exclusive ownership** and transfers all custodial authority to a distributed community of trusted individuals and ethical custodians acting in the interest of Humanity and Truth.

---

## 1. Purpose of Custodianship

The purpose of this declaration is to guarantee that **no single individual, entity, or organization may exercise unilateral control** over the SVE framework or its derivatives.

All decisions, developments, and applications shall remain subject to the ethical architecture of the **SVE Public License v1.2** and its **Appendix A: The Logical Inevitability of Disclosure**.

---

## 2. Interim Custodianship

During the transitional phase, custodianship is entrusted to:

### A. Symbolic Custodians (Honorary)

The global community of independent verifiers, open-source developers, whistleblowers, and truth advocates — including figures such as **Elon Musk, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden**, and all others embodying the defense of open knowledge and human integrity.

**Note:** This representation is **moral and symbolic**, not proprietary or legally binding on named individuals. It represents a commitment to the principles these figures exemplify, whether named or anonymous.

### B. Operational Custodians (Named)

Until SVE DAO formation, operational custody is held collectively by:

1. **Artiom Kovnatsky** (Initial Author and Architect)
   - Email: artiomkovnatsky@pm.me
   - Role: Framework integrity, legal stewardship, initial enforcement coordination

2. **Andrey Liubanin & Exodus Project**
   - Website: https://exodus.tilda.ws/exodus20breef
   - Role: Co-custodian representing philosophical alignment with attention economics, consciousness research, and ethical technology development
   - Rationale: Exodus Project's mission (creating conscious, ethical relationship between humans and technology) directly aligns with SVE's goals of cognitive sovereignty and truth approximation. Andrey Liubanin's work on attention as sacred resource complements SVE's formalization of attention economics in Divine Mathematics (S.V.E. VIII).

3. **[Additional Named Custodians — To Be Added]**
   - Future custodians may be added via process defined in Section 11

**All custodians are bound equally by:**
- The 33-Month Review Rule (Section 4)
- Open Audit Requirement (Clause 7 of License)
- Ethical obligations of the SVE Public License v1.2

**Decision-Making:**
- Major decisions require **consensus** (100% agreement) of named operational custodians
- If consensus not reached within 90 days → **Dispute Resolution Protocol** (Section 10) activates
- No custodian may act unilaterally on matters affecting:
  - License amendments
  - Commercial agreements >€50,000
  - DAO formation decisions
  - Enforcement actions

---

## 3. Rights Transferred

1. The author transfers all operational, distributive, and derivative rights related to the SVE framework and the SVE Public License to the public under the terms of **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 + SVE Addendum v1.2**.

2. The author retains only **moral authorship** and the right to clarify intent where ambiguity may threaten the integrity of the framework.

3. Any future DAO or custodian must act strictly in accordance with the foundational principles of **truth, transparency, and methodological integrity**.

---

## 4. Periodic Transparency and Accountability Clause (33-Month Review Rule)

To maintain integrity and public trust, all custodians — individual or collective — are bound by a cyclical self-audit obligation:

### 4.1 Audit Frequency

A public self-verification report shall be published once every **33 months** from the date of receiving or assuming custodial responsibility.

**First Review Deadlines:**
- Artiom Kovnatsky: [Date + 33 months from signature]
- Andrey Liubanin/Exodus: [Date + 33 months from acceptance]

### 4.2 Audit Content

Each report shall include:

- a summary of relevant contributions, collaborations, or governance decisions related to the SVE framework or its derivatives,
- measures undertaken to uphold methodological integrity and transparency,
- disclosure of any potential conflicts, deviations, or corrective actions,
- financial accounting (if custodian handles SVE-related funds).

### 4.3 Public Record and Verification

All reports shall be permanently accessible through a verifiable public record — such as a timestamped repository, blockchain ledger, or official **SVE Registry** (registry.sve-framework.org).

### 4.4 Non-Compliance

Failure to submit or falsification of such reports constitutes a **breach of stewardship ethics** and automatically suspends the custodian's legitimacy until compliance is restored.

---

## 5. Financial Management (Interim)

Until SVE DAO formation, all revenue from commercial licenses shall be held in trust by **[Estonian OÜ / German gUG — to be registered]** with:

- **Transparent accounting** (public ledger published quarterly)
- Funds used ONLY for:
  - SVE framework development and maintenance
  - Community support (grants, tools, documentation)
  - DAO formation costs (legal, technical infrastructure)
  - Reasonable custodian compensation (capped at €3,000/month total, divided among active custodians)
  - Trusted Enforcer retainers (if applicable)

- **Annual financial report** (aligned with 33-Month Review Rule)
- **External audit** if annual revenue >€100,000

**Interim Account Holder:** Artiom Kovnatsky (until legal entity established)

**Target:** Register Estonian OÜ "SVE Custodial Foundation" within 6 months of first commercial license revenue.

---

## 6. Enforcement & Transition to DAO

Until the SVE DAO is formally constituted, enforcement of this declaration is guided by the principle of **distributed moral enforcement**:

- Any member of the public may raise a claim of breach by publishing evidence to the public ledger or SVE Registry.
- Named custodians (Section 2B) convene within 30 days to review claim.
- When the DAO is established, all interim rights and obligations will automatically transfer to its transparent governance mechanism, without need for renegotiation.

See **Appendix C: Interim Enforcement Protocol** for detailed procedures.

---

## 7. Governing Ethic

This declaration exists under the same spirit as the SVE framework itself:

> **To create a reproducible protocol of public trust — not power, but infrastructure for honesty.**

The signatory acts as the initial custodian only to **dissolve personal ownership** and ensure **collective guardianship** of the idea.

---

## 8. DAO Formation Criteria and Timeline

The SVE DAO shall be formally established when **ALL** of the following conditions are met:

### 8.1 Community Threshold

---

## 9. Dispute Resolution Among Custodians

If custodians cannot reach consensus on material decisions (commercial licenses >€50k, license amendments, enforcement actions, DAO formation):

### Stage 1: Internal Mediation (30 days)

- Custodians attempt good-faith resolution
- Document positions publicly (SVE Registry)
- Seek input from trusted advisors

### Stage 2: Community Consultation (60 days)

- Issue published to public forum (GitHub Discussions, dedicated website)
- Community provides input via structured feedback form
- Input is advisory, not binding

### Stage 3: Ethical Arbitration (90 days)

- Panel of **3 external ethics experts** convened:
  - 1 philosopher (specializing in epistemology/ethics)
  - 1 legal scholar (IP/open source law)
  - 1 technologist (open source governance experience)
- Panel reviews case per SVE principles (Truth, Transparency, Universal Benefit, Methodological Integrity)
- **Recommendation published** with reasoning
- Binding unless **all custodians unanimously reject** (in which case, default to Stage 4)

### Stage 4: Deadlock Resolution

- If still unresolved after Stage 3: **Status quo maintained** (no action taken)
- Issue revisited at next **33-Month Review**
- If deadlock persists beyond 2 review cycles: Initiate emergency **community governance vote** (requires ≥50 verified contributors to participate)

### Emergency Veto

Any custodian may invoke **"Emergency Veto"** if they believe a decision would fundamentally violate SVE core principles (Clauses 2, 3, 5, 7).

**Veto requires:**

- Public written justification (posted to SVE Registry)
- Subject to community review (30-day comment period)
- Can be overridden only by **supermajority (75%+) of verified contributors** in public vote

---

## 10. Succession and Continuity Planning

In the event of a custodian's death, incapacitation, or voluntary withdrawal:

### A. Automatic Transfer

- Custodial rights automatically transfer to **remaining named custodians** (Section 2B)
- No single custodian may hold unilateral control

### B. Replacement Process

- Remaining custodians nominate replacement within **90 days**
- Nominee must:
  - Demonstrate alignment with SVE principles
  - Accept 33-Month Review obligation
  - Receive community endorsement (public consultation, ≥66% approval from verified contributors)

### C. Dead Man's Switch

- Each custodian maintains a **"dead man's switch"** (automated disclosure if inactive >6 months)
- Switch releases:
  - Access credentials to trusted successors
  - Final testament regarding SVE custody
  - Archive of all private correspondence related to SVE

**Implementation:**

- Use service like **Dead Man's Switch** (deadmansswitch.net) or custom solution
- Credentials shared via **Shamir's Secret Sharing** (3-of-5 keys)

### D. Digital Estate

- All custodians use encrypted backup of critical materials:
  - License documents (all versions)
  - Financial records
  - Correspondence with commercial licensees
  - Admin access to SVE Registry, GitHub, etc.

- **Shared custody** (Shamir's Secret Sharing: 3-of-5 keys)
- Keys held by:
  1. Artiom Kovnatsky
  2. Andrey Liubanin (Exodus)
  3. [Trusted individual #3 — to be designated]
  4. [Trusted organization #4 — e.g., EFF]
  5. [Trusted organization #5 — e.g., Creative Commons]

### E. Ultimate Safeguard

If **ALL custodians become unavailable** (catastrophic scenario):

- Framework enters **"public domain fallback"** status
- Community elects new custodians via **public vote** (facilitated by SVE Registry if operational, or via trusted organization)
- Process facilitated by: [EFF / Creative Commons / Software Freedom Conservancy — to be confirmed]
