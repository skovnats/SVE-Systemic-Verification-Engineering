# Standard Commercial License Agreement (SVE / Exodus 3.0)
**Version 1.3 — aligned with SVE Public License v1.3, Declaration of Interim Custody v1.3, and Appendices A–D**


### Authorized Public Custodians Clause

The rights and responsibilities defined under this Agreement may be exercised and signed by any verified Authorized Public Custodian listed in the SVE Public Registry (GitHub/IPFS), each acting as an independent signatory under the same Ethical Partnership Model and License terms.

Such signatures are equally binding as those executed by the Exodus 3.0 Initiative.

Authorization may be granted or revoked through community consensus (Snapshot vote) or public announcement signed by three existing custodians.

### 1. Parties
**Licensor:** *Exodus 3.0 Initiative*, acting on behalf of the public custodians of the **SVE Framework** and under stewardship of the **Declaration of Interim Custody v1.3**.  
**Licensee:** ____________________________________________  
(Company / Organization Name)  

Both parties collectively referred to as “the Parties”.

---

### 2. Scope of License
The Licensor grants the Licensee a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to deploy, integrate, or build upon the **SVE Framework** and its derivative methodologies, subject to compliance with the **SVE Public License v1.3** and all associated appendices.

This license does **not** convey ownership of intellectual property. All rights remain vested in the public stewardship defined by the Declaration of Interim Custody v1.3.

---

### 3. Ethical Partnership Model
Commercial cooperation follows the **Ethical Partnership Model (Appendix B v1.3)**:

- **Base Compensation:** cost + market rate (~ 99.9 % of regional technical-market average).  
- **Success Fee:** 11 % – 44 % of verified value (efficiency, savings, or additional revenue) generated through SVE application.  
- **Distribution:** 70 % → Community Treasury  /  20 % → Active Contributors  /  10 % → Open-Benefit Grants.  
- **Alternate Value:** if the Licensee lacks liquidity, equivalent contribution in equity, data, or measurable social benefit may substitute cash payment.

> *“Money is secondary; impact and integrity come first.”*

---

### 4. Obligations of the Licensee
1. Operate transparently and maintain an **SVE Compliance Log** (see License § 7).  
2. Allow periodic review or audit upon community request under Appendix C v1.3.  
3. Acknowledge use of the SVE methodology in publications, reports, or products.  
4. Contribute findings or improvements back to the community when possible.

---

### 5. Enforcement and Dispute Resolution
- Any alleged breach triggers a **temporary Stop-Collaboration Order** until reviewed under the **Interim Enforcement Protocol v1.3 (Light)**:  
  *pause → public evidence → community vote → public record.*  
- After community resolution, the Parties may resume, remediate, or terminate collaboration accordingly.  
- Persistent or bad-faith breaches may result in public disclosure and revocation of license rights.

---

### 6. Transparency and Audit
All payments and value exchanges under this agreement are subject to open audit within the limits of confidentiality agreed by both Parties.  
Audit summaries must be timestamped and made publicly accessible within 12 months of project completion.

---

### 7. Term and Termination
This Agreement remains in force until:
- completion of the defined project(s), or  
- mutual written termination, or  
- public revocation following a confirmed breach under Appendix C v1.3.

Termination does not relieve the Licensee of obligations regarding transparency and attribution.
