## Appendix D — Antifragility Stress Tests v1.3 (Light)

### Purpose
Ensure that the ecosystem becomes stronger under stress and transparent under failure.

### 1 Cycle
Conducted every 33 months — together with the periodic audit report.

### 2 Core Questions
1. Did any entity gain disproportionate influence?  
2. Can operations continue if one key person is absent?  
3. Are financial flows still verifiable and traceable?  
4. Have we added new independent auditors or custodians?  
5. Did any external pressure test our transparency, and how did we respond?

### 3 Outcome
Results = public report on GitHub/IPFS.  
If failures are found → automatic proposal to DAO/Snapshot vote for corrective action within 33 days.

### 4 Goal
Each test should increase resilience and decrease dependency on individuals.

### 5 Transparency of Results
Summaries of each stress test shall be timestamped and linked in the public registry for longitudinal comparison.
