## Appendix D — Antifragility Stress Tests v1.3 (Light)

### Purpose
Ensure that the ecosystem grows stronger under stress and remains transparent under failure — even without any central entity or DAO.

---

### 1️⃣ Cycle
Conducted every **33 months** together with the periodic audit report.  
Initiated by any **3 verified custodians** or **members of the Distributed Verification Network (DVN)**.

---

### 2️⃣ Core Questions
1. Did any person, group, or system gain disproportionate control?  
2. Can operations continue if any key actor or DAO disappears?  
3. Are all financial or decision flows verifiable and auditable?  
4. Were new independent auditors or custodians added?  
5. Did external pressure test transparency — and how did we respond?

---

### 3️⃣ Outcome
- Publish full report on GitHub/IPFS.  
- If failures are found → automatic corrective proposal within **33 days**.  
- If DAO is inactive → DVN assumes review and implements corrective measures with **≥2/3 consensus**.

---

### 4️⃣ Resilience Goal
Each test must **increase redundancy, widen verification, and reduce single points of failure.**  
Stress results should produce structural evolution, not stagnation.

---

### 5️⃣ Transparency of Results
- Each test summary is **timestamped**, hashed, and stored in the public registry.  
- Longitudinal comparison of all reports ensures measurable antifragility.

---

### 6️⃣ Continuity Rule
If both DAO and core custodians are absent or compromised for >12 months:
- DVN (Distributed Verification Network) automatically becomes the acting oversight body.  
- Any verified group of ≥5 independent contributors may restart audits and issue verified governance proposals.  
- All such actions remain binding if transparent, auditable, and cryptographically signed.
