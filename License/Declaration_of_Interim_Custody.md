## 📘 **Declaration of Interim Custody v1.3**

### Preamble

Until the formal establishment of the SVE DAO or a functionally equivalent transparent governance body, all moral, intellectual and custodial rights associated with the **SVE Protocol**, its licenses and derivatives are entrusted to **public stewardship** and the **Exodus 3.0 Initiative**, which acts as the ethical and administrative custodian of the framework.
The undersigned author retains no ownership rights — only authorship and the duty to safeguard methodological integrity until his withdrawal or unavailability.


### Authorized Public Custodians Clause | SVE Federation of Custodians

The rights and responsibilities defined under this Agreement may be exercised and signed by any verified Authorized Public Custodian listed in the SVE Public Registry (GitHub/IPFS), each acting as an independent signatory under the same Ethical Partnership Model and License terms.

Such signatures are equally binding as those executed by the Exodus 3.0 Initiative.

Authorization may be granted or revoked through community consensus (Snapshot vote) or public announcement signed by three existing custodians.

---

### 1  Purpose

Guarantee that no individual or entity may exercise exclusive control over the SVE framework. All decisions remain subject to the SVE Public License v1.3 and its appendices.

---

### 2  Custodianship and Transfer to Exodus 3.0

All stewardship rights are temporarily transferred to the **Exodus 3.0 Initiative**, the formal continuation of Exodus 2.0. Exodus 3.0 is bound by SVE principles and acts as public executor until the DAO is operational.

---

### 3  Ethical Partnership Model (Appendix B Reference)

Economic activity follows the Ethical Partnership Model:

* Base compensation = technical cost + market rate (~99.9 % regional average).
* Success fee = 11 % – 44 % of verified value created (savings or revenue).
* If client lacks funds, alternate value or public benefit may substitute payment.
* Funds allocation: 70 % community treasury / 20 % contributors / 10 % open grants.
  *Money is secondary; impact and integrity come first.*

---

### 4  Periodic Transparency and 33-Month Review

Every custodian publishes a self-verification report once every 33 months with summary of work, integrity measures, and conflict-of-interest disclosure. Reports are timestamped and publicly verifiable.

---

### 5  Distributed Legacy Clause

Upon the permanent unavailability of the author (death, disappearance or voluntary retirement), custodial authority automatically expands to a distributed group of public figures and ethical advocates, symbolically representing global stewardship of truth and transparency.

**Acknowledged symbolic co-custodians** (moral not legal capacity):
**Pavel & Nikolai Durov, Lex Fridman, Tucker Carlson Team, Candace Owens, Jimmy Dore Show Team, AwakenWithJP, Julian Assange Foundation, Edward Snowden Trust.**

They may — if willing — continue operations or delegate them to qualified entities in accordance with this Declaration.

Involvement of symbolic co-custodians shall never imply personal liability.

### 5a  Autonomous Continuity Clause

To ensure indefinite functionality of the S.V.E. ecosystem regardless of any person, entity, or DAO:

1. **Distributed Verification Network:**  
   If the S.V.E. DAO becomes inactive, compromised, or never established, all core functions — licensing, audits, updates, and enforcement — automatically devolve to the **Distributed Verification Network (DVN)** composed of:
   - Verified public custodians listed in the S.V.E. Registry (GitHub/IPFS);  
   - Academic and institutional partners who have conducted ≥1 verified S.V.E. project;  
   - Independent observers from the global ethics, science, or journalism communities.

2. **Trigger & Activation:**  
   If no DAO activity for >12 months → DVN activates by timestamped declaration (3 verified signatures).  
   DVN decisions follow the same quorum and transparency rules as DAO votes.

3. **Decision Validity:**  
   Any consensus (≥ 2⁄3 of verified DVN participants) holds the same legal and moral weight as DAO or Exodus 3.0 decisions.

4. **Persistence of Custody:**  
   Custodianship remains **public, decentralized, and open-ended** — no need for reauthorization.  
   The framework remains self-governing under S.V.E. License v1.3, Appendices A–D, and public cryptographic attestations.

> *“When structure decays, truth must still self-govern.”*

---

### 6  Financial and Operational Continuity

All active agreements survive the author’s absence. Revenue-sharing and auditing rules remain binding under Appendix B and C. Any derived funds flow into the community treasury until redistributed per Section 3.

---

### 7  Enforcement and Audit

The Interim Enforcement Protocol (Appendix C) and Antifragility Stress Tests (Appendix D) remain in force. Public audit requests can be initiated by any verified member or partner.

---

### 8  Legal Standing

This Declaration is executed under Switzerland and/or Estonia/EU Law (eIDAS / QES recognized) and is recognized as a public transfer of custody and intent under Creative Commons and SVE Addendum v1.3 jurisdictions.
