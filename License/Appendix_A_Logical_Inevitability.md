# Appendix A — Logical Inevitability of Disclosure (v1.3)
**Ethical & Structural Note to the S.V.E. Public License v1.3**

---

## 1️⃣ Essence
S.V.E. turns truthfulness from a moral duty into a **system property**.  
Hidden or unauthorized use creates **logical contradictions** within data, language, and outcomes — exposure becomes a deterministic event, not a moral chance.

---

## 2️⃣ Mechanism of Self-Disclosure
| Level | Description | Effect |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Methodological** | Concealment forces imitation of S.V.E. logic | Semantic fingerprints appear |
| **Network** | Each accomplice multiplies risk | Disclosure probability ↑ exponentially |
| **Digital** | Metadata & models preserve lineage | Forensic proof inevitable |
| **AI Forensics** | Algorithms detect S.V.E. reasoning patterns | Concealment measurable |

**Result:** Truth leaks through structure itself.

---

## 3️⃣ Entropy Law of Falsehood
Deception adds entropy; entropy destroys coherence.  
Over time, the chance of revelation → 1.  
**Time is an ally of truth.**

---

## 4️⃣ Moral Analogy
> *“Nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest.”* — Luke 8:17  

S.V.E. makes this theological axiom an **engineering reality**:  
a system designed for coherence cannot sustain deceit.

---

## 5️⃣ Implications
| Actor | Outcome of Concealment |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Governments / Intel** | Fragmentation → Leaks → Loss of legitimacy |
| **Corporations** | Forensic similarity → Reputational collapse |
| **Public Sphere** | Honesty = stable equilibrium; deception = self-termination |

---

## 6️⃣ Conclusion
**Truth amplifies itself — falsehood decays.**  
Within S.V.E., disclosure is **not optional**; it is **mathematically inevitable**.  
To hide truth inside this architecture is to trigger its revelation.

---

> *“Transparency is not a policy; it’s a physical law of information.”* ✝️


Any attempt to exploit a truth-verification protocol covertly **inverts its function** and triggers an irreversible process of self-revelation.

Within this architecture, **disclosure is not a possibility — it is a mathematical certainty.**
