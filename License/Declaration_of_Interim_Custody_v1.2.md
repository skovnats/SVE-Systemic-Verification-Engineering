# Declaration of Interim Custody and Community Stewardship

**SVE Framework — Transitional Governance Charter v1.2**

---

## Preamble

Until the formal establishment of the **SVE DAO**, all moral, intellectual, and custodial rights associated with the SVE Protocol, the SVE Public License, and their derivative works shall be held in **collective public stewardship**.

This declaration ensures that the principles of transparency, accountability, and universal benefit remain preserved during the transitional phase of the project.

The undersigned author hereby **renounces exclusive ownership** and transfers all custodial authority to a distributed community of trusted individuals and ethical custodians acting in the interest of Humanity and Truth.

---

## 1. Purpose of Custodianship

The purpose of this declaration is to guarantee that **no single individual, entity, or organization may exercise unilateral control** over the SVE framework or its derivatives.

All decisions, developments, and applications shall remain subject to the ethical architecture of the **SVE Public License v1.2** and its **Appendix A: The Logical Inevitability of Disclosure**.

---

## 2. Interim Custodianship

During the transitional phase, custodianship is entrusted to:

### A. Symbolic Custodians (Honorary)

The global community of independent verifiers, open-source developers, whistleblowers, and truth advocates — including figures such as **Elon Musk, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden**, and all others embodying the defense of open knowledge and human integrity.

**Note:** This representation is **moral and symbolic**, not proprietary or legally binding on named individuals. It represents a commitment to the principles these figures exemplify, whether named or anonymous.

### B. Operational Custodians (Named)

Until SVE DAO formation, operational custody is held collectively by:

1. **Artiom Kovnatsky** (Initial Author and Architect)
   - Email: artiomkovnatsky@pm.me
   - Role: Framework integrity, legal stewardship, initial enforcement coordination

2. **Andrey Liubanin & Exodus Project**
   - Website: https://exodus.tilda.ws/exodus20breef
   - Role: Co-custodian representing philosophical alignment with attention economics, consciousness research, and ethical technology development
   - Rationale: Exodus Project's mission (creating conscious, ethical relationship between humans and technology) directly aligns with SVE's goals of cognitive sovereignty and truth approximation. Andrey Liubanin's work on attention as sacred resource complements SVE's formalization of attention economics in Divine Mathematics (S.V.E. VIII).

3. **[Additional Named Custodians — To Be Added]**
   - Future custodians may be added via process defined in Section 11

**All custodians are bound equally by:**
- The 33-Month Review Rule (Section 4)
- Open Audit Requirement (Clause 7 of License)
- Ethical obligations of the SVE Public License v1.2

**Decision-Making:**
- Major decisions require **consensus** (100% agreement) of named operational custodians
- If consensus not reached within 90 days → **Dispute Resolution Protocol** (Section 10) activates
- No custodian may act unilaterally on matters affecting:
  - License amendments
  - Commercial agreements >€50,000
  - DAO formation decisions
  - Enforcement actions

---

## 3. Rights Transferred

1. The author transfers all operational, distributive, and derivative rights related to the SVE framework and the SVE Public License to the public under the terms of **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 + SVE Addendum v1.2**.

2. The author retains only **moral authorship** and the right to clarify intent where ambiguity may threaten the integrity of the framework.

3. Any future DAO or custodian must act strictly in accordance with the foundational principles of **truth, transparency, and methodological integrity**.

---

## 4. Periodic Transparency and Accountability Clause (33-Month Review Rule)

To maintain integrity and public trust, all custodians — individual or collective — are bound by a cyclical self-audit obligation:

### 4.1 Audit Frequency

A public self-verification report shall be published once every **33 months** from the date of receiving or assuming custodial responsibility.

**First Review Deadlines:**
- Artiom Kovnatsky: [Date + 33 months from signature]
- Andrey Liubanin/Exodus: [Date + 33 months from acceptance]

### 4.2 Audit Content

Each report shall include:

- a summary of relevant contributions, collaborations, or governance decisions related to the SVE framework or its derivatives,
- measures undertaken to uphold methodological integrity and transparency,
- disclosure of any potential conflicts, deviations, or corrective actions,
- financial accounting (if custodian handles SVE-related funds).

### 4.3 Public Record and Verification

All reports shall be permanently accessible through a verifiable public record — such as a timestamped repository, blockchain ledger, or official **SVE Registry** (registry.sve-framework.org).

### 4.4 Non-Compliance

Failure to submit or falsification of such reports constitutes a **breach of stewardship ethics** and automatically suspends the custodian's legitimacy until compliance is restored.

---

## 5. Financial Management (Interim)

Until SVE DAO formation, all revenue from commercial licenses shall be held in trust by **[Estonian OÜ / German gUG — to be registered]** with:

- **Transparent accounting** (public ledger published quarterly)
- Funds used ONLY for:
  - SVE framework development and maintenance
  - Community support (grants, tools, documentation)
  - DAO formation costs (legal, technical infrastructure)
  - Reasonable custodian compensation (capped at €3,000/month total, divided among active custodians)
  - Trusted Enforcer retainers (if applicable)

- **Annual financial report** (aligned with 33-Month Review Rule)
- **External audit** if annual revenue >€100,000

**Interim Account Holder:** Artiom Kovnatsky (until legal entity established)

**Target:** Register Estonian OÜ "SVE Custodial Foundation" within 6 months of first commercial license revenue.

---

## 6. Enforcement & Transition to DAO

Until the SVE DAO is formally constituted, enforcement of this declaration is guided by the principle of **distributed moral enforcement**:

- Any member of the public may raise a claim of breach by publishing evidence to the public ledger or SVE Registry.
- Named custodians (Section 2B) convene within 30 days to review claim.
- When the DAO is established, all interim rights and obligations will automatically transfer to its transparent governance mechanism, without need for renegotiation.

See **Appendix C: Interim Enforcement Protocol** for detailed procedures.

---

## 7. Governing Ethic

This declaration exists under the same spirit as the SVE framework itself:

> **To create a reproducible protocol of public trust — not power, but infrastructure for honesty.**

The signatory acts as the initial custodian only to **dissolve personal ownership** and ensure **collective guardianship** of the idea.

---

## 8. DAO Formation Criteria and Timeline

The SVE DAO shall be formally established when **ALL** of the following conditions are met:

### 8.1 Community Threshold

---

## 9. Dispute Resolution Among Custodians

If custodians cannot reach consensus on material decisions (commercial licenses >€50k, license amendments, enforcement actions, DAO formation):

### Stage 1: Internal Mediation (30 days)

- Custodians attempt good-faith resolution
- Document positions publicly (SVE Registry)
- Seek input from trusted advisors

### Stage 2: Community Consultation (60 days)

- Issue published to public forum (GitHub Discussions, dedicated website)
- Community provides input via structured feedback form
- Input is advisory, not binding

### Stage 3: Ethical Arbitration (90 days)

- Panel of **3 external ethics experts** convened:
  - 1 philosopher (specializing in epistemology/ethics)
  - 1 legal scholar (IP/open source law)
  - 1 technologist (open source governance experience)
- Panel reviews case per SVE principles (Truth, Transparency, Universal Benefit, Methodological Integrity)
- **Recommendation published** with reasoning
- Binding unless **all custodians unanimously reject** (in which case, default to Stage 4)

### Stage 4: Deadlock Resolution

- If still unresolved after Stage 3: **Status quo maintained** (no action taken)
- Issue revisited at next **33-Month Review**
- If deadlock persists beyond 2 review cycles: Initiate emergency **community governance vote** (requires ≥50 verified contributors to participate)

### Emergency Veto

Any custodian may invoke **"Emergency Veto"** if they believe a decision would fundamentally violate SVE core principles (Clauses 2, 3, 5, 7).

**Veto requires:**

- Public written justification (posted to SVE Registry)
- Subject to community review (30-day comment period)
- Can be overridden only by **supermajority (75%+) of verified contributors** in public vote

---

## 10. Succession and Continuity Planning

In the event of a custodian's death, incapacitation, or voluntary withdrawal:

### A. Automatic Transfer

- Custodial rights automatically transfer to **remaining named custodians** (Section 2B)
- No single custodian may hold unilateral control

### B. Replacement Process

- Remaining custodians nominate replacement within **90 days**
- Nominee must:
  - Demonstrate alignment with SVE principles
  - Accept 33-Month Review obligation
  - Receive community endorsement (public consultation, ≥66% approval from verified contributors)

### C. Dead Man's Switch

- Each custodian maintains a **"dead man's switch"** (automated disclosure if inactive >6 months)
- Switch releases:
  - Access credentials to trusted successors
  - Final testament regarding SVE custody
  - Archive of all private correspondence related to SVE

**Implementation:**

- Use service like **Dead Man's Switch** (deadmansswitch.net) or custom solution
- Credentials shared via **Shamir's Secret Sharing** (3-of-5 keys)

### D. Digital Estate

- All custodians use encrypted backup of critical materials:
  - License documents (all versions)
  - Financial records
  - Correspondence with commercial licensees
  - Admin access to SVE Registry, GitHub, etc.

- **Shared custody** (Shamir's Secret Sharing: 3-of-5 keys)
- Keys held by:
  1. Artiom Kovnatsky
  2. Andrey Liubanin (Exodus)
  3. [Trusted individual #3 — to be designated]
  4. [Trusted organization #4 — e.g., EFF]
  5. [Trusted organization #5 — e.g., Creative Commons]

### E. Ultimate Safeguard

If **ALL custodians become unavailable** (catastrophic scenario):

- Framework enters **"public domain fallback"** status
- Community elects new custodians via **public vote** (facilitated by SVE Registry if operational, or via trusted organization)
- Process facilitated by: [EFF / Creative Commons / Software Freedom Conservancy — to be confirmed]
