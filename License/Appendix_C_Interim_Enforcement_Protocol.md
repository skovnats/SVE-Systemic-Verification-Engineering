## Appendix C — Interim Enforcement Protocol v1.3 (Light)

### 1 Principle
Enforcement exists to protect integrity, not to punish.

### 2 Trigger
Any verified member or client may file a public breach report (GitHub Issue / IPFS record).

### 3 Immediate Action
Upon a valid claim:
- Collaboration with the accused party is **temporarily paused** (“Stop Collaboration Order”).
- Evidence and response must be published within 14 days.
- If risk to public safety or data integrity is evident, the pause may be enacted instantly by any 2 verified members pending formal filing.

### 4 Community Resolution
After publication:
- A **7-day Snapshot vote** (simple majority) determines one of three outcomes:  
  **(a)** Resume collaboration;  
  **(b)** Require remediation plan + audit;  
  **(c)** Terminate relationship and publicly record breach.

### 5 Appeal
Any party may request a second review within 33 days, judged by trusted enforcers or DAO auditors.

### 6 Transparency
All enforcement logs and votes remain permanently public.
