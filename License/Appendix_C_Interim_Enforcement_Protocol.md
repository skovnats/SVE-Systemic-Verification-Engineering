## Appendix C — Interim Enforcement Protocol v1.3 (Light)

### 1️⃣ Principle
Enforcement exists to **protect integrity, not punish**.  
Actions must remain transparent, proportional, and restorative.

---

### 2️⃣ Trigger
Any verified member, custodian, or client may file a **public breach report**  
(via GitHub Issue, IPFS record, or timestamped signed statement).

---

### 3️⃣ Immediate Action
Upon valid claim:
- Collaboration is **temporarily paused** (“Stop Collaboration Order”).  
- Evidence + response published within **14 days**.  
- If public risk or data compromise is evident, any **2 verified custodians** may enforce a temporary pause pending review.

---

### 4️⃣ Community Resolution
After publication:
- A **7-day Snapshot vote** (simple majority) determines outcome:  
  **(a)** Resume collaboration;  
  **(b)** Require remediation plan + audit;  
  **(c)** Terminate cooperation and record breach.  

If no quorum forms, default = **pause extended** until review completes.

---

### 5️⃣ Appeal
Any party may request a **secondary review** within **33 days**,  
conducted by **trusted enforcers or DAO auditors**.  
Final decision is timestamped and publicly verifiable.

---

### 6️⃣ Transparency
All enforcement records (claims, votes, resolutions)  
must remain **permanently accessible and hashed** in the public S.V.E. registry.
