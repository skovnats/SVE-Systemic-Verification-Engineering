# Appendix C: Interim Enforcement Protocol

**SVE Public License v1.2 — Enforcement During Transitional Phase**

---

## Preamble

This appendix defines the enforcement mechanism for the **SVE Public License v1.2** during the transitional period before the **SVE DAO** is formally established.

Enforcement operates through **distributed community verification**, ensuring accountability without requiring centralized authority.

---

## 1. Violation Reporting

### 1.1 Who Can Report

**Any member of the public** may report suspected violations of the SVE Public License v1.2.

This includes:
- Verified contributors to SVE ecosystem
- Commercial licensees
- Journalists or researchers
- Anonymous whistleblowers (with verifiable evidence)

### 1.2 How to Report

**Submit violation report to:**
- **SVE Registry:** registry.sve-framework.org/report-violation
- **Email:** enforcement@sve-framework.org (if Registry not yet operational)
- **Public forum:** GitHub Issues on official SVE repository

**Required information:**
1. **Alleged violator:** Name of entity/individual
2. **Nature of violation:** Which clause(s) of License violated (1-7)
3. **Evidence:** Documentation, screenshots, links, testimony
4. **Date discovered:** When violation first observed
5. **Reporter contact:** Email (can request anonymity, but must be reachable)

**Evidence standards:**
- **Strong:** Direct documentation (contracts, internal memos, screenshots with metadata)
- **Moderate:** Testimony from credible sources, circumstantial evidence
- **Weak:** Hearsay, speculation without documentation

---

## 2. Community Review Process

### 2.1 Initial Triage (7 days)

**Operational Custodians** (per Declaration Section 2B) review report:
- Is claim credible? (sufficient evidence?)
- Is it within SVE License scope? (or unrelated complaint?)
- Is it material? (significant violation vs. minor technical error?)

**Outcomes:**
- **Proceed:** Move to Stage 2 (formal investigation)
- **Request more info:** Contact reporter for clarification (14-day deadline)
- **Dismiss:** Insufficient evidence or not a license violation (with public explanation)

All triage decisions **published to SVE Registry** with reasoning.

---

### 2.2 Formal Investigation (30 days)

**Custodians convene investigation panel:**
- Minimum 2 custodians must participate
- If conflict of interest (custodian knows alleged violator), recuse and appoint substitute

**Investigation steps:**
1. **Contact alleged violator:** 
   - Notify of complaint
   - Request response (14 days)
   - Request supporting documentation

2. **Review evidence:**
   - Examine all documentation from both sides
   - Consult with domain experts if needed (e.g., legal counsel for Clause 2 violations)

3. **Community input:**
   - Publish investigation summary (redacting confidential info if necessary)
   - 14-day public comment period
   - Consider community feedback in decision

**Decision criteria:**
- **Preponderance of evidence** standard (more likely than not)
- Apply SVE principles: Truth, Transparency, Methodological Integrity

---

### 2.3 Adjudication and Verdict (60 days total from report)

**Custodians vote on findings:**
- **Consensus preferred** (100% agreement)
- If consensus not reached: **Majority vote** (>50%)
- If tied: **External arbitration** (per Declaration Section 9, Stage 3)

**Possible verdicts:**
1. **No violation:** Claim dismissed, alleged violator cleared
2. **Minor violation:** Technical error, no malicious intent → **Warning** + 30-day cure period
3. **Material violation:** Clear breach of license → **Remediation required** (see Section 3)
4. **Severe violation:** Willful, repeated, or malicious → **Immediate termination** + public disclosure

**All verdicts published to SVE Registry** with:
- Summary of findings
- Reasoning (referencing specific License clauses)
- Evidence considered (redacted if sensitive)
- Remediation requirements (if applicable)

---

## 3. Remediation and Penalties

### 3.1 Warning (Minor Violations)

**For:** First-time, non-malicious violations (e.g., forgot to update Audit Log, missed attribution)

4. **Public benefit projects**: 15% of remainder (grants to journalists, academics using SVE)

**Accounting:** All financial recoveries **publicly disclosed** in quarterly financial reports (per Declaration Section 5).

---

## 4. Trusted Enforcers (Interim Designation)

Until SVE DAO is established, the following organizations are **designated as Trusted Enforcers** (per License Clause 6):

### 4.1 Designated Organizations

**Primary Enforcers:**
1. **Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)**
   - Focus: Digital rights, open knowledge
   - Contact: legal@eff.org
   - Status: [To be confirmed — requires EFF consent]

2. **Creative Commons**
   - Focus: Open licensing, IP rights
   - Contact: info@creativecommons.org
   - Status: [To be confirmed]

3. **Software Freedom Conservancy**
   - Focus: Open source licensing enforcement
   - Contact: legal@sfconservancy.org
   - Status: [To be confirmed]

**Role of Trusted Enforcers:**
- Provide legal counsel (pro bono or reduced rate)
- File lawsuits on behalf of SVE (if necessary)
- Assist with complex investigations (e.g., forensic analysis)

**Activation:**
- Custodians may **request assistance** from Trusted Enforcers for:
  - Cases requiring legal action (lawsuits)
  - High-stakes violations (major corporation, government)
  - Complex technical analysis (digital forensics)

**Note:** These are **proposed** Trusted Enforcers. Formal agreements must be signed before activation. If not yet signed, custodians proceed with community enforcement + hired legal counsel.

---

### 4.2 Ad-Hoc Legal Counsel

If Trusted Enforcers unavailable or conflicted:
- Custodians may **hire legal counsel** on case-by-case basis
- Funded by: SVE treasury (interim financial account per Declaration Section 5)
- Selection criteria: Experience with IP/open source law, alignment with SVE principles

---

## 5. Appeals Process

### 5.1 Grounds for Appeal

Alleged violator may appeal verdict if:
- **New evidence** discovered (not available during investigation)
- **Procedural error** (investigation did not follow protocol)
- **Disproportionate penalty** (punishment doesn't fit violation)

### 5.2 Appeal Procedure

1. **File appeal** within **30 days** of verdict
   - Submit to: appeals@sve-framework.org or SVE Registry
   - Must include: Grounds for appeal + supporting evidence

2. **Appeal Review Panel:**
   - 3-person panel: 1 custodian + 2 external experts (ethics/legal)
   - Panel members must not have participated in original investigation
   - Review completed within **60 days**

3. **Outcomes:**
   - **Affirm:** Original verdict stands
   - **Modify:** Adjust penalty (e.g., reduce from Termination to Suspension)
   - **Reverse:** Overturn verdict, alleged violator cleared

4. **Final decision** published to SVE Registry
   - Appeal decisions are **FINAL** (no further appeals within SVE system)
   - Violator may still pursue external legal remedies (courts) if they believe verdict unjust

---

## 6. Statute of Limitations

**Time limits for reporting violations:**
- **Ongoing violations:** No limit (can be reported anytime while continuing)
- **Past violations:** Must report within **3 years** of violation occurring
- **Discovery rule:** Clock starts when violation discovered (or reasonably should have been discovered)

**Rationale:** Balance accountability with finality. Old violations (>3 years) may no longer be enforceable, but pattern of behavior can be considered.

---

## 7. Whistleblower Protection

**Protections for good-faith reporters:**
1. **Anonymity:** Reporter may request anonymity (identity not disclosed publicly)
2. **No retaliation:** Violator **prohibited** from retaliating against reporter (threats, lawsuits, harassment)
3. **Legal support:** If violator retaliates, SVE provides legal defense (via Trusted Enforcers or hired counsel)
4. **Reward:** Up to 15% of financial recovery (if investigation leads to disgorgement/damages)

**Bad faith reporting:**
- If reporter files **false or malicious** complaint:
  - May be banned from filing future reports
  - May be liable for violator's legal costs (if violator proves malice)

---

## 8. Transparency and Public Record

**All enforcement actions publicly documented:**
- SVE Registry maintains **public enforcement log**:
  - Date reported
  - Nature of violation (summary)
  - Verdict and reasoning
  - Remediation status
  - Financial recovery (if any)

**Exceptions (limited confidentiality):**
- Whistleblower identity (if requested)
- Trade secrets (if revealed during investigation, redact from public version)
- Ongoing legal proceedings (some details may be sealed temporarily)

**Principle:** Default to transparency, confidentiality only when necessary to protect legitimate interests.

---

## 9. Transition to SVE DAO

When SVE DAO is established (per Declaration Section 8):
1. All pending enforcement cases **automatically transfer** to DAO
2. DAO assumes all rights/obligations under License Clause 6
3. This Interim Enforcement Protocol **sunsets** (replaced by DAO governance)
4. All historical enforcement records **archived** and maintained by DAO

**No retroactive changes:** Verdicts rendered under Interim Protocol remain valid, not subject to DAO re-adjudication (unless new evidence emerges).
