## Appendix B — Ethical Partnership Model (Commercial Tiers v1.3)

### Purpose
Defines a transparent, ethical revenue-share model for all commercial uses of S.V.E.  
Aligns compensation strictly with **verified benefit** — not speculation or monopoly.

---

### 1️⃣ Core Principles
1. **Integrity before profit** — truth overrides gain.  
2. **Proportional reward** — pay grows with measurable value.  
3. **Open accountability** — every transaction auditable (License §7).  
4. **Human-first** — social or data value may substitute payment if funds limited.

---

### 2️⃣ Base Compensation
Each contributor receives:
- payment = **median market rate (≈ 99.9 % regional average)**;  
- reimbursement for verified infrastructure costs.

Ensures parity with industry norms — no markup, no exploitation.

---

### 3️⃣ Success Fee / Impact Share
Applied only on verified outcomes:

| Tier | Scope | Share of Verified Value |
|------|--------|--------------------------|
| **11 %** | Minimal integration | 11 % |
| **22 %** | Standard deployment | 22 % |
| **33 %** | Multi-domain optimization | 33 % |
| **44 %** | Complex / mission-critical | 44 % |

*Verified value = documented savings, efficiency gain, risk reduction, or new revenue (S.V.E.-audited).*

---

### 4️⃣ Fund Distribution
| Allocation | Share | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Community Treasury | 70 % | Research, maintenance, grants |
| Active Contributors | 20 % | Work-based reward |
| Open-Benefit Grants | 10 % | Education & transparency |

Immutable without public amendment.

---

### 5️⃣ Limited-Resource Clients
If liquidity lacking:
- offer **equity**, **tokenized stake**, or **public contribution**;  
- open-publish verified results (“Verified by S.V.E.”).  
No financial barrier shall block projects serving the public good.

---

### 6️⃣ Transparency & Audit
Each engagement must keep an **S.V.E. Compliance Log** with:
- project & tier;  
- proof of benefit;  
- payment & distribution summary.  

Public by default; embargo ≤ 12 months.

---

### 7️⃣ Ethical Flexibility
Percentages adjustable only by mutual written consent and public release.  
Community Treasury may waive fees for hardship or force majeure.

---

### 8️⃣ Guiding Maxim
> *“Money is secondary; impact and integrity come first.”*  
> Any conflict between profit and truth is resolved in favor of truth.

---

### 9️⃣ Governance
Updated by **distributed consensus** of:
- **Exodus 3.0 custodians** and/or **S.V.E. DAO** (once active);  
- **Verified Public Custodians** listed in the S.V.E. Registry;  
- and **recognized institutional or academic partners** (via open endorsement).

Amendments require:
- public proposal and 90-day comment period,  
- ≥ 2/3 multi-group approval (custodians + representatives + partners),  
- publication with timestamp in the public S.V.E. Registry (GitHub + IPFS).

This structure ensures no single entity — person, custodian, or DAO — can unilaterally control framework evolution.
