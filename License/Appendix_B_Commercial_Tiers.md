## **Appendix B — Ethical Partnership Model (Commercial Tiers v1.3)**

### **Purpose**

This appendix defines the ethical, transparent, and reproducible financial framework for all commercial or quasi-commercial engagements performed under the **SVE Public License v1.2 / v1.3**.
It replaces conventional “pricing packages” with a cooperative revenue-share model that aligns compensation strictly with verified public and client benefit.

---

### **1  Principles**

1. **Integrity before profit.** No payment structure may compromise methodological honesty or transparency.
2. **Proportional reward.** Compensation grows only with measurable benefit created.
3. **Open accountability.** All transactions are auditable under Clause 7 of the SVE License.
4. **Human-first policy.** If a client lacks funds, equivalent value in data, equity, or verified social impact may substitute payment.

---

### **2  Base Compensation**

Each contributor or contractor receives:

* payment equal to **the median market rate (≈ 99.9 % of regional technical-market average)** for equivalent work; and
* reimbursement of directly verified infrastructure or equipment costs at market value.

This ensures parity with industry norms without speculative mark-ups.

### **3  Success Fee / Revenue Share**

A variable **impact-linked success fee** applies on verified outcomes:

| Tier     | Project Depth / Scope                            | Share of verified value (benefit created) |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **11 %** | Rapid case / minimal integration                 | 11 %                                      |
| **22 %** | Standard deployment / baseline improvement       | 22 %                                      |
| **33 %** | Extended engagement / multi-domain optimization  | 33 %                                      |
| **44 %** | Complex mission-critical / “impossible” projects | 44 %                                      |

“Verified value” means *documented savings, efficiency gain, risk reduction, or additional revenue* confirmed by SVE-auditable metrics.

---

### **4  Distribution of Funds**

All collected commercial revenue is automatically divided as follows:

* **70 %** → Community Treasury (for research, maintenance, public grants);
* **20 %** → Active contributors (pro rata by verified work hours or impact score);
* **10 %** → Open-Benefit Initiatives and micro-grants for education and transparency projects.

No individual may unilaterally alter this distribution.

---

### **5  Clients with Limited Resources**

If a partner organization or individual cannot meet standard fees, an alternative arrangement is encouraged:

* partial equity or tokenized stake in future benefits;
* public credit or co-branding (“Verified by SVE” badge);
* open publication of results to the SVE Registry as non-monetary value.
  Financial hardship shall **never** block collaboration that serves the public good.

---

### **6  Transparency & Audit Requirement**

Every commercial engagement must include an **SVE Compliance Log** (see License §7) containing:

* project description and tier level;
* proof of benefit calculation and auditor verification;
* payment records and distribution summary.
  Logs are public by default or released after agreed embargo (max 12 months).

---

### **7  Ethical Flexibility**

Parties may modify percentages only by mutual consent and publication of the amendment under the same transparency conditions.
In case of client bankruptcy or force majeure, the Community Treasury may waive fees partially or fully.

---

### **8  Guiding Maxim**

> *“Money is secondary; impact and integrity come first.”*
> Any conflict between profit and truth is resolved in favor of truth.

---

### **9  Revision and Governance**

This appendix may be updated by consensus of the Exodus 3.0 custodians or the SVE DAO once formed.
Version control and timestamped records shall be maintained in the public SVE Registry (GitHub + IPFS).
