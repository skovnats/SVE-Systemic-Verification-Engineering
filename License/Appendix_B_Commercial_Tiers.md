## FAQ

**Q: Can I use SVE internally without a commercial license?**
A: If your organization is for-profit and using SVE for business purposes (decision-making, product development, competitive advantage), you need a commercial license. If you're using it for personal education or open research (published freely), you don't.

**Q: What if I'm between Tier 1 and Tier 2?**
A: Choose the tier based on your current revenue. You can upgrade mid-year if you cross the threshold (pro-rated pricing).

**Q: Can I negotiate a custom tier?**
A: Yes, especially for Tier 3. Email artiomkovnatsky@pm.me with your specific needs.

**Q: What if I violate Clause 3 (intelligence/manipulation prohibition)?**
A: If you're an intelligence/propaganda entity, you CANNOT obtain a commercial license unless you meet Clause 4 (Radical Transparency) requirements. This is non-negotiable. Attempted circumvention = permanent ban + public disclosure.

**Q: Can I use SVE for government work?**
A: Yes, if:
   - Government agency operates with transparency (Clause 4)
   - Use serves public benefit (verifiable)
   - Regular external audits (quarterly minimum)
   - Public reports published
   
   Classified/secret government use is PROHIBITED per Clause 3.

**Q: What's included in "Priority Support"?**
A: Tier 2/3 get email support with guaranteed response times (24-48 hours). Tier 1 gets community forum support (best-effort, no SLA).

**Q: Can I use SVE to build a commercial product (e.g., "TruthChecker Pro")?**
A: Yes, with appropriate tier license. Your product must:
   - Credit SVE framework (attribution)
   - Maintain Open Audit Log
   - Not violate Clause 3 (no manipulation/propaganda tools)
   - Your derivative must also be ShareAlike (Clause 5)

**Q: What happens to my license if SVE DAO dissolves?**
A: Per Declaration Section 10E: Framework enters "public domain fallback". Your existing license remains valid. New community custodians elected. You would be grandfathered in.
